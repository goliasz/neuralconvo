L180382 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
L180381 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
L180380 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
L180379 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
L180375 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L180374 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ I've always thought that myself.
L180373 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ They have noble faces.
L180370 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ How lovely.
L180369 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ And here is one of Frederick's mother.
L180352 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh?
L180351 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
L180348 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Two, please.
L180347 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ One or two?
L180346 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes please, two.
L180345 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Mr. Merrick, sugar?
L180508 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh Frederick.
L180507 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ ...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
L180506 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
L180505 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
L180504 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
L180503 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ That I am very little different from him.
L180502 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
L180501 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
L180500 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ ...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
L180499 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Hmmm?
L180498 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ More romances for John?
L180497 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
L180496 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ You stay with me.
L180372 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ And here are my mother and father.
L180371 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes.
L180350 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Do you?
L180349 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ John loves the house.
L180168 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...
L180167 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Well, these things take time.
L180166 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
L180165 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
L180164 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
L180163 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
L180162 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
L180161 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
L180160 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
L180159 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
L180158 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
L180157 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L180156 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
L180155 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
L179960 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ No, I think a whiskey.
L179959 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
L179958 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
L179957 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Did it go well, darling?
L179847 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I'll join you shortly.
L179846 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ You won't be long?
L179972 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I'll get my bag.
L179971 +++$+++ u825 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Like this. 
L179970 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ What is it?
L179969 +++$+++ u825 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Our man is sick. Come right away.
L179889 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Did you see it?
L179888 +++$+++ u825 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ I found it.
L179887 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes?
L179886 +++$+++ u825 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
L180635 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ Shut up!
L180634 +++$+++ u825 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Don't!
L180633 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ I'll show you! I'll show you!
L180632 +++$+++ u825 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L180631 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
L180630 +++$+++ u825 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
L180629 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
L180628 +++$+++ u825 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
L180627 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
L180145 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ Right... Right.
L180144 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Now I think we really do understand one another.
L180141 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
L180140 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
L180139 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ I want him back!
L180138 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ You don't own this man!
L180137 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
L180136 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ All you do is profit from another man's misery!
L180135 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
L180134 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
L180133 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
L180132 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
L180131 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
L180130 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
L180129 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ Never mind that, I want my man!
L180128 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Just a moment, how did you get in here?
L180127 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ I want my man back.
L179988 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Everything will be seen to.
L179987 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
L179985 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his "fall". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab.
L179984 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
L179983 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ This man belongs in hospital.
L179982 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy.
L179981 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
L179980 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
L179979 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ He must have taken quite a fall.
L179978 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ He fell.  He falls.
L179977 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ What happened?
L179976 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I intend to.
L179975 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
L179974 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ What do you mean?
L179973 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
L180516 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
L180515 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
L180318 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Please do.
L180317 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
L180316 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
L180315 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
L180314 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Has the response picked up?
L180256 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?
L180255 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
L180254 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Don't we?
L180242 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
L180241 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Do you think they'll go along with us?
L180240 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
L180239 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Well, yes.
L180238 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
L180237 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I could easily arrange...
L180236 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
L180235 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.
L180234 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes, I think I can.
L180233 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Can you imagine what his life has been like?
L180227 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
L180226 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Treves. Well done.
L180218 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
L180217 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ I don't understand.
L180216 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
L180210 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
L180209 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
L180208 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
L180193 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ And what was that, John?
L180192 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Oh yes?
L180179 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
L180178 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
L180177 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
L180176 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ ...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
L180175 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
L180174 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
L180151 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ ...Yes, Sir.
L180150 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
L180149 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
L180148 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
L180147 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
L180146 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
L180126 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
L180125 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
L180124 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
L180123 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
L180122 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
L180121 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
L180120 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
L180119 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
L180118 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Good! How is the patient?
L180117 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
L180116 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
L180016 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
L180015 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
L180014 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ No, more of an acquaintance.
L180013 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Oh, is he a friend of yours?
L180012 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
L180011 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
L180010 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes sir.
L180009 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
L180008 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
L180007 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
L180006 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
L180005 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
L180004 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Indeed!
L180003 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
L180000 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
L179999 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ It's quite nutritious, sir.
L179998 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ You've acquired a taste for this?
L179997 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Good morning, sir.
L179996 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Good morning, Treves.
L180222 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
L180221 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I am very pleased to meet you.
L180220 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
L180213 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
L180212 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ What is it, Treves?
L180205 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
L180204 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ ...everyone has been very kind.
L180203 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
L180202 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ ...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
L180189 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
L180188 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ Are you comfortable here?
L180187 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I feel much better. Thank you.
L180186 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
L180185 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
L180184 +++$+++ u827 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ CARR +++$+++ How are you feeling today?
L179952 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
L179951 +++$+++ u828 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ You never mentioned his mental state.
L179934 +++$+++ u828 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Nothing of any importance, eh?
L179933 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I don't know what I've got.
L179932 +++$+++ u828 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
L179931 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
L179930 +++$+++ u828 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
L179892 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
L179891 +++$+++ u828 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ I say Freddie, what are you about?
L179878 +++$+++ u828 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ What a mess.
L179877 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
L179876 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
L179875 +++$+++ u828 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ FOX +++$+++ Three quarters of an hour.
L179874 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ How long has this man been here?
L180711 +++$+++ u829 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ K. HEN +++$+++ I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say "I love you". What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly.
L180710 +++$+++ u830 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KATH +++$+++ Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
L180709 +++$+++ u829 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ K. HEN +++$+++ What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
L180708 +++$+++ u830 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KATH +++$+++ O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
L180707 +++$+++ u829 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ K. HEN +++$+++ An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
L180706 +++$+++ u830 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KATH +++$+++ Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
L180705 +++$+++ u829 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ K. HEN +++$+++ O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
L180704 +++$+++ u830 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KATH +++$+++ Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
L180703 +++$+++ u829 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ K. HEN +++$+++ Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
L180436 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
L180435 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh no?
L180434 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
L180433 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
L180432 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
L180431 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
L180428 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ No, but I certainly shall.
L180427 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ Have you read it?
L180426 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
L180425 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Romance!
L180424 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
L180423 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Tell me about it, please!
L180422 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
L180421 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Alas, no.
L180420 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ You've never been?
L180419 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
L180418 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
L180417 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
L180416 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes.
L180415 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ She's very pretty, your mother.
L180414 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
L180413 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
L180412 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ I knew you'd understand. Here.
L180411 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh, no.
L180410 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
L180409 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Good day...!
L180699 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes.
L180698 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
L180697 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
L180696 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ Is he... dying then?
L180695 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
L180694 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ How awful for John.
L180693 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
L180692 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
L180691 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
L180690 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
L180408 +++$+++ u831 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ KENDAL +++$+++ Good day, Mr. Merrick.
L180407 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
L180661 +++$+++ u837 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ PLUMED DWARF +++$+++ You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
L180660 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L180659 +++$+++ u837 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ PLUMED DWARF +++$+++ Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
L180658 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh no, my friend...
L180657 +++$+++ u837 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ PLUMED DWARF +++$+++ I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
L180646 +++$+++ u837 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ PLUMED DWARF +++$+++ Won't be a moment.
L180645 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes.
L180644 +++$+++ u837 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ PLUMED DWARF +++$+++ Of course! You want out?
L180643 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You're English.
L180642 +++$+++ u837 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ PLUMED DWARF +++$+++ Want to come out?
L180641 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ y-y-yes--

L180402 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
L180401 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I'll have to find some more.
L180399 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ ...I learned a long time ago.
L180398 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
L180397 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ The main spire.
L180396 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ What's this?
L180395 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
L180394 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
L180393 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
L180392 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ Where did you get this box?
L180391 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Thank you... very much.
L180390 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
L180389 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes.
L180388 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
L180385 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Good morning.
L180384 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
L180329 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ No, nothing.
L180328 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
L180327 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Thank you very much.
L180325 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes.
L180324 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
L180732 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You too, my friend. Goodnight.
L180731 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Goodnight John. Sleep well.
L180729 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
L180728 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Then I shouldn't change anything?
L180727 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ No, John, not one that I can see.
L180726 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
L180725 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes John?
L180723 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
L180722 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh yes! It was wonderful!
L180721 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
L180720 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes, very soon.
L180719 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
L180716 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
L180715 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh no, I couldn't.
L180714 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Stand up, John. Let them see you.
L180689 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ John.... how can you ever forgive me?
L180688 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Mr. Treves! Treves.
L180551 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
L180550 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
L180549 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
L180548 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Is it the one you wanted?
L180547 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ There is one more thing, John. Here.
L180546 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ My home.
L180545 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
L180544 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes.
L180543 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You did this for me?
L180542 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes, John.
L180541 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ ...my... home?
L180483 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
L180482 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ You want a dressing bag, John?
L180481 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
L180480 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
L180479 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
L180478 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
L180477 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ The cathedral is coming along nicely.
L180471 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I thought as much.
L180470 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
L180469 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ ...Can you cure me?
L180468 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes, John?
L180467 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
L180466 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
L180465 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
L180406 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?
L180405 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Good morning.
L180404 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Good morning, John.

L180377 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Your mother?
L180376 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Would you... would you like to see my mother?
L180368 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
L180367 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
L180366 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ The Children. Where are your children
L180365 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Of course.
L180364 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ The children! May I see?
L180363 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Oh, our relatives... the children.
L180362 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Who are they of?
L180361 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Oh yes.
L180360 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
L180359 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Not at all, John.
L180358 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
L180357 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ How is your tea, John?
L180356 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Ohhh...
L180355 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ That's a canopy, John.
L180354 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
L180339 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
L180338 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
L180332 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
L180331 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Thank you very much.
L180330 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ You look splendid, John.
L180312 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
L180311 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ How long will I stay here?
L180310 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Of course! What did you think?
L180309 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ The hospital?
L180308 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes.
L180307 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ This... is my new home?
L180297 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
L180296 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
L180295 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Good evening. How are you feeling?
L180232 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
L180231 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
L180230 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
L180229 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You did not ask me.
L180228 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
L180196 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
L180195 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ ...Yes potatoes... but...
L180191 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
L180190 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
L180182 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
L180181 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
L180173 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you!
L180172 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
L180171 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Righteousness for his namesake.
L180170 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Righteousness...
L180169 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
L180109 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Hello, my name is John Merrick.
L180108 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
L180104 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Hello... my name is... John Merrick.
L180103 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
L180102 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Mmmerrick.
L180101 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Say "Mmmerrick."
L180100 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Mmmerrick.
L180099 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Say "Mmmerrick."
L180098 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Merrick...
L180097 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Say "Merrick".
L180096 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ John... Merrick
L180095 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ John Merrick.
L180094 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ My... name is...
L180093 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ My name is...
L180092 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Hello...
L180091 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
L180090 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes.
L180089 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
L180088 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes!
L180087 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
L180086 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yyess.
L180085 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yyyess.
L180084 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ ...Yyes
L180083 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes John!
L180082 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
L180540 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Welcome home, John.
L180539 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
L180493 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
L180492 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Well...
L180491 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
L180490 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ A dressing bag?
L180489 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes. John wants it.
L180488 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Very smart indeed.
L180487 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ A dressing bag.
L180486 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Yes sir.  What's that?
L180485 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
L180484 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
L180463 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
L180462 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
L180461 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
L180460 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
L180459 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
L180458 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
L180457 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
L180456 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
L180455 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
L180453 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
L180452 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Watery headed bunch.
L180113 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
L180112 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
L180111 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
L180110 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
L180076 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
L180075 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
L180071 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
L180070 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ No, he's very upset about something.
L180069 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Won't come out, eh?
L180068 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
L180067 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
L180041 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes! The workhouse!
L180040 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ The workhouse.
L180033 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes... Yes, let's go in.
L180032 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
L180031 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
L180030 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ I've heard.
L180029 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
L180028 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Fine.
L180027 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
L180601 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
L180600 +++$+++ u834 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NIGHT PORTER +++$+++ YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
L180599 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
L180598 +++$+++ u834 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NIGHT PORTER +++$+++ When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
L180597 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ HE'S GONE!
L180596 +++$+++ u834 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NIGHT PORTER +++$+++ Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
L180595 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
L180594 +++$+++ u834 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NIGHT PORTER +++$+++ I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
L180593 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
L179912 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
L179911 +++$+++ u836 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ OWNER +++$+++ Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
L179910 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
L179904 +++$+++ u836 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ OWNER +++$+++ Never mind. I'm the owner.
L179903 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Pardon me?
L179902 +++$+++ u836 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ OWNER +++$+++ Handsomely?... Who sent you?
L179901 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
L179900 +++$+++ u836 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ OWNER +++$+++ I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
L179899 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
L179898 +++$+++ u836 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ OWNER +++$+++ And who might you be, sir?
L179897 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Are you the proprietor?
L268150 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Goodbye, Looseleaf.
L268149 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
L268148 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ They were enemies.  We were at war.
L268147 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
L268146 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ If what?
L268145 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I don't think so.  It could have been.
L268144 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
L268143 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
L268142 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Everybody thinks that.
L268141 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I know you think that.
L268140 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're an imbecile.
L268139 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Okay.  Okay.
L268138 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You.
L268137 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Me?
L268136 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Maybe it's time you got out.
L268135 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
L268134 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You did?
L268133 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You never played a violin.
L268132 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Tit for tat--as simple as that.
L268131 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
L268130 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ In what way, pray tell?
L268129 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
L268128 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What's this?
L268127 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
L268090 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
L268089 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Hi, Penelope.
L268071 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ She was always a rotten wife!  She was against everything manly you ever wanted to do.  He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit.  She made him become a life insurance salesman instead.
L268070 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno.
L268069 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
L268068 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
L268067 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ All the more reason to go to Africa.
L268066 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
L268065 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
L268064 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno.
L268063 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
L268051 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
L268050 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
L268043 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You keep on saying "deep" and "deeply." I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime.
L268042 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
L268041 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
L268027 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
L268026 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
L268025 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I didn't know we had any women left.
L268024 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
L268023 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
L268022 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
L268021 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
L268020 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
L268019 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Go to the funeral?
L267948 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Sorry.
L267947 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
L267946 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Really?
L267945 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
L267944 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Oh.  I'd forgotten.
L267943 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
L267942 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ When?
L267941 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You told me.
L267940 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ How do you know that?
L267939 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
L267938 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
L267937 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Huh.
L267936 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
L267935 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Excuse me.
L267930 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You know me, boy.
L267929 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What's funny about that?
L267928 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
L267927 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
L267926 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The educational process.
L267925 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno, boy.
L267898 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ How about breakfast, wife?
L267897 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ First Nagasaki--now this.
L267896 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Could have happened to anybody.
L267883 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
L267882 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Otherwise, how are things?
L267875 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Let's talk about something else.
L267874 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And how were things?
L267871 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Haven't got one.
L267870 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
L267869 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You ever own a motorcycle?
L267868 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Go home!
L267867 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I've been looking at motorcycles.
L267504 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I'm lonesome already.
L267503 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
L267502 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Months?
L267501 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
L267500 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
L267498 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.
L267497 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
L267496 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ How short the skirts are.
L267495 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Let's talk about it some other time.
L267494 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You know what gets me?
L267493 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ So long, Colonel.
L267492 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
L267491 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
L267490 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I'm liable to find anything!
L267489 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Go home.
L267488 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
L267487 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Go home!
L267486 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
L267485 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
L267484 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ What'll you do for transportation?
L267483 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
L267482 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Can I have the Cadillac?
L267481 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
L267480 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
L267479 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The hell with the diamonds!
L267478 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
L267477 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Go home!
L267476 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You know what gets me?
L267475 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You're lucky, boy.  My house is gonna be filled with people.
L267474 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ This room is full of ghosts.
L267473 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
L267472 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
L267471 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I didn't tell you everything.
L267470 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
L267469 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
L267468 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Tell them yourself!
L267467 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
L267466 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
L267465 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
L267464 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ At least!
L267463 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ At least we found the diamonds.
L267462 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
L267461 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
L267460 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Oh, shit.
L267459 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You know what gets me?
L267458 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You know what gets me?
L267457 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Home.
L267456 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Must have changed that law.
L267455 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I suppose.
L267454 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Used to be against the law, didn't it?
L267453 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Um.
L267452 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ How all the magazines show tits today.
L267451 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No.
L267450 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ You know what gets me?
L267449 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Home is important to a man.
L267448 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
L267447 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
L267446 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We'll see.
L267445 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
L267444 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Home, sweet home.
L267443 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I'm gonna wet my pants.
L267442 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
L267441 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
L267440 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We've never met.
L267439 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Didn't recognize you.
L267438 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ A bitch.
L267437 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ It's a bitch.
L267436 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Hm?
L267435 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno, boy.
L267434 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Miss me, baby?
L268177 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Thank God!
L268176 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
L268175 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Out!
L268174 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
L268173 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Out!  Out!
L268172 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You're my buddy.
L268171 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
L268170 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
L268169 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
L268168 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
L268167 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're hollow, like a woman.
L268166 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I wouldn't drop my gun.
L268165 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
L268164 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Gee whiz--
L268163 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
L268162 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ What went wrong?
L268161 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ To make an ass of yourself.
L268160 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You invited me.
L268159 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
L268158 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ For Africa.
L268157 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ For what?
L268156 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ We got to get another pilot.
L268155 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What?
L268154 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
L268124 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
L268123 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
L268118 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things.
L268117 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
L268116 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm interested in long-term expectations.
L268115 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You're making a joke.
L268114 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Fifty years?
L268085 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That can be arranged.
L268084 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I just want one true adventure before I die.
L268083 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
L268082 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I've considered that.
L268081 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
L268080 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
L268079 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ What an awful sound!
L268077 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You actually sold insurance!
L268076 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Insurance!
L268060 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Pass the fucking catsup.
L268059 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
L268058 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
L268057 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
L268056 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
L268049 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
L268048 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Blue soup.
L268047 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
L268046 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
L268045 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Our pleasure.
L268044 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
L268037 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
L268036 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I forget mine for years on end.
L268035 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
L268034 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You've come to the right man.
L268033 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I wanted to apologize.
L268032 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The posies are for her?
L268031 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Is Penelope in?
L268030 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ How are you, honeybunch?
L268029 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Hello.
L268251 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
L268250 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm talking to you gently now.
L268249 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
L268241 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Everybody simply evaporates!  There are guest issues to be fought out here--or to be argued, at least. The enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt!  I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin.
L268240 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's your house, Dad.
L268239 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
L268238 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't want to fight you.
L268237 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
L268219 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
L268218 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dad--
L268217 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
L268216 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Gee whiz, Dad--
L268215 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
L268214 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
L268213 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Open the bolt!
L268212 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No.
L268211 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
L268210 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No.
L268209 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That's a rifle you have?
L268208 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Nothing.
L268207 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What's this?
L268206 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What's this?
L268205 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Mom?
L268088 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's Mom.
L268087 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Who was it?
L268086 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dad?
L268055 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
L268054 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No.
L268053 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
L268052 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm a man.
L267913 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
L267912 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What kind of exercise?
L267862 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Leave a tip.
L267861 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ A hundred dollars for breakfast?
L267860 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
L267859 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dad--
L267844 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Make it fast.
L267843 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Can I get dressed first?
L267842 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The smallest thing I've got.
L267841 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ A hundred dollars!
L267838 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
L267837 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Play?
L267755 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Mom?
L267754 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Damn.
L267753 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
L267748 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Scat!
L267747 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
L267746 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Will you go to bed?
L267745 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
L267744 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Penelope!
L267743 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
L267742 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Penelope!
L267741 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
L267740 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
L267739 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
L267738 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Can't it keep till morning?
L267737 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
L267736 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I can't take my eyes off you.
L267735 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Why don't you go to bed--son.
L267734 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
L267733 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
L267732 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
L267731 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
L267683 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sir?
L267682 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
L267630 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
L267629 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
L267628 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, no, no, no, no.
L267627 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're a very good boy to respond that way.
L267626 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
L267625 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
L267624 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They're not engaged.
L267623 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
L267622 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
L267621 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're supposed to get hurt!
L267620 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
L267619 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
L267618 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sir?
L267617 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
L267616 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
L267615 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
L267614 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Mhravitch.
L267613 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
L267611 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
L267610 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
L267609 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Where did you get the poison?
L267608 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
L267607 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Go on.
L267606 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
L267605 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't know.
L267604 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
L267603 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Uck.
L267602 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
L267601 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Mhravitch.
L267600 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
L267599 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Wow.
L267598 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
L267597 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Tell me that!  Tell me that!
L267596 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
L267595 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Tell me that.
L267594 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
L267593 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ "The sting."
L267592 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
L267591 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ "The sting."
L267590 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
L267589 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dad was never in England?
L267588 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Oh hell.
L267587 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ England?
L267586 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ "Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
L267585 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Tell me some true stories about Dad.
L267584 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
L267583 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
L267582 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
L267581 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
L267580 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What does he do--of an athletic nature?
L267579 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ "Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
L267578 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No.
L267577 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
L267576 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It makes life spicy.
L267575 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What's good about that?
L267574 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Excellent!
L267573 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He insults him all the time.
L267572 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
L267571 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She has a master's degree in English literature.
L267570 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ College?
L267569 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They were in the same creative writing class.
L267568 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ College!
L267567 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She met him at college.
L267566 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
L267565 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
L267564 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
L267563 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He worships Father.
L267562 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
L267561 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Everybody says he was so brave.
L267560 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Man and boy.
L267559 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
L267558 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
L267557 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'll see.
L267556 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
L267555 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
L267554 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
L267553 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Where's Mom?
L267552 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
L267551 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Is anybody besides you here now?
L267550 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
L267549 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dr. Woodly.
L267548 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
L267547 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Do you mind if I ask who you are?
L267546 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Life has denied me that thrill.
L267545 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Do you know who Wanda June is?
L267544 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Ask it!
L267543 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Are you--do you--
L267542 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You were about to ask a question?
L267541 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Are you--
L267540 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Hello.
L267539 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Hello.
L267538 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ As a matter of fact--I am home.
L267537 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sir?
L267536 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ As a matter of fact--
L267535 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Anybody home?
L268318 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Do it, Norbert.
L268317 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
L268316 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
L268315 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!
L268314 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You've killed women?
L268313 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
L268309 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Out!
L268308 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
L268305 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
L268304 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The National Safety Council would be appalled.
L268303 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
L268300 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Load it for her.
L268299 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ How do I load?
L268298 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ There it is.  Give it to me.
L268297 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Help your mother find the bullet.
L268296 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Where's the bullet?
L268295 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
L268294 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I mean it!
L268293 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
L268292 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
L268291 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Ah!  The lady is armed.
L268290 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
L268281 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
L268280 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
L268271 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Stop!
L268270 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ This is suicide.  Go get the police.
L268263 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Don't!
L268262 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm going to call the police.
L268248 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You hope this, too?
L268247 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
L268246 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
L268245 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No.
L268244 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ No.
L268243 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
L268242 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
L268235 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
L268234 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
L268233 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ If you've lived a good life, fought well--
L268232 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
L268231 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What a handsome word.
L268230 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Honor, I suppose.
L268229 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
L268228 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ No you don't.
L268227 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I plan to live one hundred years!
L268226 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
L268225 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm teaching my son to be a man.
L268224 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
L268223 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ If he thinks he's man enough.
L268222 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You're begging him to kill you?
L268221 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
L268220 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He's a child!
L268204 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response!
L268203 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Like what?
L268202 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
L268201 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Sounds quite beautiful.
L268200 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
L268199 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Blue soup?
L268198 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
L268197 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It seems highly intelligent to me.
L268196 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
L268195 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
L268194 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
L268193 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
L268192 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
L268191 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Rifle?
L268190 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
L268189 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
L268188 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
L268186 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I see.
L268185 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
L268183 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
L268182 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
L268181 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Just one favor.
L268180 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
L268179 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Almost a Christmas scene.
L268178 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Well--what have we here?  A family.
L268122 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
L268121 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Things.
L268112 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Hope.
L268111 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
L268110 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
L268109 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Two hundred years old.
L268108 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
L268107 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He cried.
L268106 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
L268105 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He knows you shattered his violin.
L268104 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
L268103 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Unless she has nerve.
L268102 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
L268101 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Did you like it, dear?
L268100 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It's a big and busy funeral home.
L268099 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ A dozen?
L268098 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
L268097 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You took him to the funeral, I hear.
L268096 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ If he wants to go.
L268095 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I came for Paul as well.
L268094 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
L268093 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
L268092 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Sneaking in the back door.
L268091 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I came for my clothes.
L267984 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
L267983 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Why not?
L267982 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ No you're not!
L267981 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
L267980 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L267979 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
L267978 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I don't think so.
L267977 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And no one's there now?
L267976 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Yes.
L267975 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And he keeps it in his apartment?
L267974 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
L267973 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And what is his most cherished possession?
L267972 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Yes.
L267971 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The doctor.
L267970 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
L267969 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You learned this in some college course?
L267968 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
L267967 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Go on.
L267966 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
L267965 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
L267964 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
L267963 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Tell me about its sexual roots.
L267962 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
L267961 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Such as?...
L267960 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
L267959 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Fish can't feel.
L267958 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
L267957 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It couldn't!
L267956 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
L267955 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
L267954 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
L267953 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That's what you're supposed to say.
L267952 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
L267951 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What then?
L267950 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ No.
L267949 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Let me guess--breakfast is served?
L267933 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
L267932 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
L267931 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
L267924 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
L267923 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ They don't have to feel like slaves.
L267922 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ People now have dignity when frying eggs?
L267921 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
L267920 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
L267919 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ People don't use that word any more.
L267918 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
L267916 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're a woman, aren't you?
L267915 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
L267914 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
L267911 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!
L267910 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You're wrong.
L267909 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
L267908 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What a honeymoon.
L267907 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
L267906 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ "Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
L267905 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Which one?
L267904 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
L267903 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
L267902 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
L267901 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
L267900 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
L267899 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Breakfast?
L267864 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Ram it up your ass!
L267863 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I have some change!
L267858 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
L267857 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I have a brain.
L267856 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
L267855 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
L267854 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
L267853 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.
L267852 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Turn around?
L267851 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Now--turn around, if you would.
L267849 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!
L267848 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
L267847 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You used to like it stark!
L267846 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It's so--so stark.
L267845 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
L267840 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
L267839 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He hasn't had breakfast yet.
L267836 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.
L267835 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ A trip, you mean?
L267834 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
L267833 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I did?
L267832 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
L267831 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
L267830 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Now that's what I call fun.
L267823 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Do say hello to your mother.
L267822 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Say hello to your mother.
L267821 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
L267818 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
L267817 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
L267813 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
L267812 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Please--
L267811 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I could carve a better man out of a banana!
L267810 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Harold!
L267802 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Have some.
L267801 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
L267785 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Thank God!
L267784 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Nothing would please me more.
L267783 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
L267779 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
L267778 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Paul said you were awfully sick.

L267776 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Shouldn't you lie down?
L267775 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We all are.
L267774 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He's a very decent man, Harold.
L267773 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
L267772 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ We thought it was an emergency.
L267771 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Your old beau?
L267770 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ We thought a doctor might help.
L267769 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What's that all about?
L267761 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
L267760 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Bluh.
L267703 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
L267702 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
L267701 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
L267700 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
L267699 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
L267698 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
L267697 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Situation.
L267696 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Disease?
L267695 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
L267694 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
L267693 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
L267692 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You were well adjusted to my being dead?
L267691 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
L267690 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Like hugging a lamp post.
L267689 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Give us time.
L267688 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What's the matter?
L267674 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
L267673 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Not at all.
L267672 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
L267671 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ How do you do?
L267533 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
L267532 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Some kind of animal?
L267531 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
L267530 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What do you do for a living?
L267529 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
L267528 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ This is crazy.
L267527 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You are woman.  I know woman well.
L267526 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You don't even know me.
L267525 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Daughter--I love you very much.
L267524 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm engaged.
L267523 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
L267522 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
L267521 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What time do you get off work, my child?
L267520 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
L267519 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
L267518 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Sir?
L267517 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
L267516 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Eighteen--  and a half.
L267515 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
L267514 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Can I help you, sir?
L267513 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Heaven.
L267512 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ "Hamburger Heaven."
L267169 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
L267168 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
L268396 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
L268395 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
L268394 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
L268393 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Leave the rifle here.
L268392 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
L268391 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L268390 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
L268389 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ New lives begin!
L268388 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It's trash now, like mine.
L268387 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Thank you--for my life.
L268386 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
L268385 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Can't do it.
L268384 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
L268383 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ No.
L268382 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Get up.
L268381 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ No.  No.
L268380 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I've enjoyed being man.
L268379 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Don't shoot.
L268378 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
L268377 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ What is this thing that kills me?
L268376 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ If you want to be found that way.
L268375 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
L268374 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
L268373 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Like the saber-toothed tiger.
L268372 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
L268371 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
L268370 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ No!
L268369 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm going to shoot you now.
L268368 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
L268367 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We never quit fighting until we're dead.
L268366 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ More clowning!  Don't you see?
L268365 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
L268364 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I'm utterly satisfied.
L268363 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Here.  Finish the job.
L268362 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
L268361 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Was I ever of use?
L268360 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
L268359 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're too modest.
L268358 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
L268357 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The new hero is you.
L268356 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
L268355 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
L268354 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ My violin is avenged!
L268353 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Don Quixote.
L268352 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
L268351 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I see.
L268350 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
L268349 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
L268348 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
L268347 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
L268346 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Poison.
L268345 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
L268344 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
L268343 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ With spittle?
L268342 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I've struck my blow.
L268341 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Cut me open.  Find out.
L268340 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
L268339 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
L268338 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
L268337 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You hope.
L268336 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ King Arthur.
L268335 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm an honorable clown?
L268334 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
L268333 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
L268332 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
L268331 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
L268330 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
L268329 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I love you!  Have a cigar!
L268328 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
L268327 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
L268326 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I'm high as a kite.
L268325 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
L268320 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And terror, if you don't mind.
L268319 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Hands and knees, you say?
L268311 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Comical?
L268310 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
L268289 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
L268288 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You're a son of a bitch.
L268287 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
L268286 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
L268285 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Now who's being cruel?
L268284 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You're old--so old.
L268283 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Oooooo.  That hurt.
L268282 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
L268279 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ We'll find out now, won't we?
L268278 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
L268277 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You haven't heard me yet.
L268276 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
L268275 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Correct.
L268274 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
L268273 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Yes.
L268272 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
L268269 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He's a champion after all. WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are.
L268268 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
L268267 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What brought you back?
L268266 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
L268265 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ This is man to man.
L268261 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Lest we forget how cruel you are.
L268260 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ There's a certain amount of information there.
L268259 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
L268258 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It died for your sins.
L267829 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Quarantine, possibly.  You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without.  Goodbye.
L267828 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What for?
L267827 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
L267820 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You were wrong, you quack!
L267819 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I thought she was a widow.
L267815 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
L267814 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Good Lord.
L267809 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Everything about you is the editorial we.  Take that away from you, and you'd disappear.
L267808 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
L267807 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We have, have we?
L267806 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
L267805 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Wasn't that sweet of me?
L267800 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Hundreds.
L267799 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Are you've seen it work cures?
L267798 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
L267797 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I've never heard of it.
L267796 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
L267795 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Would you say that again?
L267794 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Pacqualinincheewa root.
L267793 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I was going to ask.
L267792 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
L267791 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud."
L267790 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You have chills?
L267789 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
L267788 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You've been bitten by bats?
L267787 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
L267786 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
L267782 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What a brilliant diagnosis!
L267781 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Ah!  You're ambulatory!
L267729 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Good night.
L267728 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fianc is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
L267727 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ None.
L267726 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
L267725 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I feel the same way.  What next?
L267714 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ She's crying because she's so happy.
L267713 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Are--are you crying, Penelope?
L267712 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
L267711 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
L267710 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
L267706 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I came back.
L267705 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
L267433 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I won't try to keep up with you. I'm not as fast on my feet as I once was.
L267432 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I've literally got to run!
L267431 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
L267430 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I've got to run!
L267429 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And her fianc!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
L267428 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ And her fianc!
L267427 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
L267426 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now!
L267425 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
L267424 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.

L267422 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
L267421 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ She still has just the one child-- the boy?
L267420 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Will you please go?  An emergency!
L267419 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
L267418 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ She's fine.  Please--
L267417 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Ahh--then she's still alive.
L267416 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
L267415 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I'm a neighbor.  I have the apartment across the hall.  I have to go to the hospital now.  An emergency.
L267414 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
L267413 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
L267412 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We'll miss you so.
L267411 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
L267410 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Call her back--tell her to head for the hospital.  Tell the hospital to expect her.  I'll leave right now.
L267409 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Oh dear.
L267408 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ ...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
L267407 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Hello, Mother.
L267406 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
L267404 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
L267403 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ He's dead, you know.
L267402 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We tried to be.  We tried to be.
L267401 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
L267400 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ But here you are inside, aren't you?
L267399 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ It's always locked.
L267398 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
L267393 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You startled me.

L268153 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys.
L268152 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What will you do, Colonel?
L268151 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ So long, you guys.
L268126 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno.

L267895 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
L267894 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ How horrible.
L267893 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
L267892 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What happened?
L267891 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
L267890 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Who's dead?
L267889 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
L267888 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ For what?
L267887 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.

L267881 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
L267880 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
L267879 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ There was so much going on.
L267878 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You didn't even find that out?
L267877 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ She did?
L267876 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Alice got married again.
L267873 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
L267872 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ And you went home unannounced, too?
L267177 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
L267176 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ It was a bitch.
L267175 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You don't know?
L267174 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ I dunno, boy.
L267173 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
L267172 +++$+++ u1241 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ LOOSELEAF +++$+++ Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
L268009 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
L268008 +++$+++ u1247 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WANDA JUNE +++$+++ Won't you please join our club? Please?
L268007 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
L268006 +++$+++ u1247 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WANDA JUNE +++$+++ I'm only ten years old.
L268005 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ Thought you were another wife, maybe.
L268004 +++$+++ u1247 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WANDA JUNE +++$+++ Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  I don't really know him.
L268016 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace.
L268015 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ VON KONIGSWALD +++$+++ Ja?
L268014 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
L268013 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ VON KONIGSWALD +++$+++ That is sad.
L268012 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ VON KONIGSWALD +++$+++ Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
L268011 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ Premature ejaculation.
L268010 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ VON KONIGSWALD +++$+++ Because he was cruel?
L268003 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
L268002 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ VON KONIGSWALD +++$+++ You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
L268001 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ Yes.
L268000 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ VON KONIGSWALD +++$+++ You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
L267999 +++$+++ u1242 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ MILDRED +++$+++ I heard you were looking for me.
L267998 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ VON KONIGSWALD +++$+++ Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
L267661 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
L267660 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No.
L267659 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
L267658 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't touch me.
L267645 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ The wife of Harold Ryan is going to marry a pansy next?  This is the end of Western Civilization as far as I'm concerned.  You must be crazy as a fruitcake.
L267644 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'll kill myself.
L267643 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
L267642 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't want to live any more.
L267641 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ That goes double for me.
L267632 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ What a relief!
L267631 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Thank God!
L267317 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
L267316 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
L267313 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
L267312 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
L267311 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
L267310 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.

L267308 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ What's this?
L267307 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!

L267305 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
L267304 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
L267303 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
L267302 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?

L267766 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Okay.
L267765 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Then get him.
L267764 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah.
L267763 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It is an emergency, isn't it?
L267762 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Really?
L267759 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He can hardly talk.
L267758 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What does he say to do?
L267757 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
L267756 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What are his symptoms?
L267716 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
L267715 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ That's why I'm crying.
L267681 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It is you, isn't it, Harold?
L267680 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't get it.

L267678 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What?
L267677 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ That man is your father.
L267676 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Mom?

L267666 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Then who flushed the toilet?
L267665 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No.
L267664 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Is Norbert still here?

L267638 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What difference does that make?  Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
L267637 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Who have you been talking to?
L267636 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
L267315 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
L267314 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Where will you be?
L267211 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's beautiful.
L267210 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I hate that thing.
L267209 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.

L267204 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
L267203 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I was afraid to ask.
L267202 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ In a railroad accident many years ago.
L267201 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ How did she lose her feet?
L267200 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
L267199 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Still lives with his mother.
L267198 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Not true.
L267197 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You're the only woman he ever took out.
L267196 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ That's an interesting piece of news.
L267195 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
L267194 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ A what kind of doctor?
L267193 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
L267192 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Thank you, kind sir.
L267191 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
L267190 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
L267189 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He's alive!
L267188 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He's a ghost!
L267187 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You're married!  You've already got a husband!
L267186 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Oh, Paul--
L267185 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Stay home tonight!
L267184 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I know.
L267183 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
L267182 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I told you this was a simple-minded play.
L267181 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
L267180 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
L267721 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ No!
L267720 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He is my father.
L267719 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ He isn't?
L267718 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He isn't any friend of Father.
L267717 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
L267285 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
L267284 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
L267237 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Keeps fairies away!
L267236 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I hate that thing.
L267233 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
L267232 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's fine!
L267231 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
L267230 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't worry about it.
L267229 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
L267228 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ My father!
L267227 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
L267226 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Everything stays as it is!
L267221 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Oh?
L267220 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We don't have a maid any more.
L267214 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You're going out?
L267213 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You're taking Mom out tonight?
L267212 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
L268120 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.
L268119 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You and Harold are friends?
L267663 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
L267662 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It's true.
L267657 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
L267656 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You were wonderful.
L267655 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
L267654 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm saying no--and thank you.
L267653 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You're saying no.
L267652 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
L267651 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Marry me instead.
L267650 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L267649 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
L267648 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
L267647 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ How long has this been going on?
L267646 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Possibly.
L267635 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
L267634 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What's the matter now?
L267388 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
L267387 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What was it?
L267386 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
L267385 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
L267384 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
L267383 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Did you talk to Paul?
L267380 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, "Happy Birthday, Somebody Else."
L267379 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ How nice.
L267378 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
L267377 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ A what?
L267376 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
L267375 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You figure!
L267374 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
L267373 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
L267372 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ The park!
L267371 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
L267370 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Is he coming home?
L267369 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Far as I know.
L267368 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Is he all right?
L267367 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Yeah.
L267366 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Did you see him?
L267328 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
L267327 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What then?
L267294 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?
L267293 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
L267292 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
L267277 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Women are always late.  You'll find out.
L267276 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Coming.
L267267 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Good night.
L267266 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
L267265 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I see.
L267264 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ That's when I'll get my confidence back.
L267263 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm touched.
L267262 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
L267261 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
L267260 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Something happens to my confidence.
L267259 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Yes?
L267258 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and I wrestled. But when I get with you, and I say to myself, "My God--here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--"
L267257 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
L267256 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
L267255 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I know.
L267254 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
L267253 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm glad.
L267252 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
L267251 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ That's something I suppose.
L267250 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ He'd assume we had.
L267249 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
L267248 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
L267247 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Doing what?
L267246 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
L267244 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
L267243 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
L267242 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Please--
L268322 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Goodbye.
L268321 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Do it!
L268307 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
L268306 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Everything's going to be beautiful.
L268257 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
L268256 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You fool, you fool.
L268255 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ It's really that bad?
L268254 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Get out of here.
L267826 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Thanks.
L267825 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Tell her to have a nice trip.
L267824 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
L267804 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I believe in miracles now.
L267803 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Thank you.  Thank you very much.
L267709 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ How neat.  How keen.
L267708 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ We met here earlier this evening.
L267707 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You know each other?
L267364 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
L267363 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ That's been said before.
L267362 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It's a jungle out there.
L267361 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
L267360 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He's not your son.
L267359 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
L267358 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ We've got to rescue him.
L267357 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
L267356 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Paul's only twelve years old.
L267355 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ They didn't murder me.
L267354 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
L267353 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
L267352 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm amazed.
L267351 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
L267350 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Why would you do that?
L267349 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
L267348 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Meaning?
L267347 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
L267346 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It's suicide!
L267345 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I wish Paul luck.
L267344 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
L267343 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
L267342 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
L267341 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ What kind of a life is that?
L267340 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
L267339 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ The what?
L267338 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ That's the XKE.
L267337 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
L267336 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
L267335 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
L267334 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ As long as he keeps out of the park.
L267333 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
L267332 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It is?
L267331 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ This is very good for us.
L267323 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Tonight's the night.
L267322 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
L267297 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you.
L267296 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What?
L267295 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
L267235 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
L267234 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ "War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
L267225 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
L267224 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
L267223 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?

L267218 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
L267217 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ We made the date three months ago.
L267216 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Take plenty of cigars.

L267170 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
L267382 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
L267381 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ "Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
L267330 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.

L267326 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
L267325 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
L267324 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
L267321 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
L267320 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--

But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!

L267287 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.

L267279 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!

L267273 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
L267272 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Phooey.
L267271 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.

L267996 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ VON KONIGSWALD +++$+++ You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--
L267995 +++$+++ u1247 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WANDA JUNE +++$+++ We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
L267994 +++$+++ u1246 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ VON KONIGSWALD +++$+++ It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
L267993 +++$+++ u1247 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WANDA JUNE +++$+++ Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.

L371642 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
L371641 +++$+++ u2017 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DAGO RED +++$+++ What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
L371619 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
L371618 +++$+++ u2017 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DAGO RED +++$+++ Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
L371279 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
L371278 +++$+++ u2017 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DAGO RED +++$+++ I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
L371277 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What is, Red, the intention or the act?
L371276 +++$+++ u2017 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DAGO RED +++$+++ I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
L371275 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
L371274 +++$+++ u2017 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DAGO RED +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
L371271 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ He's parted his moorings.
L371270 +++$+++ u2017 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DAGO RED +++$+++ You talked to Walt?
L371269 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
L371222 +++$+++ u2017 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DAGO RED +++$+++ Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski  Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
L371221 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
L371212 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
L371211 +++$+++ u2017 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DAGO RED +++$+++ There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
L371810 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
L371809 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Stop him! Stop that man!
L371369 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Hey, that's great, Henry! Good thinking!
L371368 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
L371367 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What are you going to do with him?
L371157 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
L371156 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You boys'll have to go to work early.
L371154 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ How you, Radar?
L371153 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Yes, O'Reilly?
L371142 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
L371141 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
L371021 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Just one for a start.
L371020 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
L371017 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
L371016 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Never this close.
L371015 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Good. You've both been working close to the front.
L371014 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ They give you copies to burn.
L371013 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
L371012 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
L371011 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
L371010 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
L371881 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
L371880 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Y'all mind the store.
L371823 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
L371822 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You really think we hurt him that bad?
L371821 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
L371748 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Or her figger.
L371747 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
L371707 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ There's only one way.
L371706 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
L371700 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
L371699 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
L371624 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Not enough to be a pro.
L371623 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
L371622 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Epidural hematoma?
L371621 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Look at that right eye.
L371620 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
L371255 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ He said it for us all, Walt.
L371254 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Miss you, Walt.
L371252 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Pour one for Painless.
L371251 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
L371186 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
L371185 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Don't you use olives?
L371181 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ No.  Or why you should.
L371180 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
L371179 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Back home.
L371178 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Which hospital?
L371177 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Hospital.
L371176 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Where?
L371175 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ That's right.
L371174 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
L371173 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Home.
L371172 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
L371864 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
L371863 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ You  must  open  me  up  again?
L371412 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
L371411 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
L371103 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
L371102 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
L371101 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
L371100 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
L371124 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ ...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
L371123 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Us. Lead us not into...
L371118 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You make a mean martini, kid.
L371117 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ So long, Ho-Jon.
L371114 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Same general idea.
L371113 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Wisconsin.
L371112 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
L371111 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
L371108 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't drink intoxicants.
L371107 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
L371052 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
L371051 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
L371050 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What the hell's going on here?
L371049 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
L371876 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Perfectionist.
L371875 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
L371874 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What's there to do? You found the sliver.
L371873 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
L371835 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
L371834 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ We got to stop them right here.
L371800 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
L371799 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What?
L371928 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
L371927 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
L371918 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
L371917 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
L371899 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
L371898 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
L371897 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
L371896 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
L371879 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
L371878 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ We could steal one of the choppers.
L371877 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
L371872 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Be right with you.
L371871 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Any time. Whenever we want.
L371870 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ When?
L371869 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
L371853 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Same here. You can retire my number.
L371852 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
L371817 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Yeah, if I can.
L371816 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
L371806 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
L371805 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Look at the size of those two beasts.
L371776 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
L371775 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
L371770 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
L371769 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
L371766 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
L371765 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
L371764 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Never heard of him.
L371761 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
L371760 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
L371705 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.  You're a witness.
L371704 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
L371703 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
L371702 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
L371701 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
L371694 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ An application to Androscoggin College.
L371693 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What's he got to write, for God's sake?
L371692 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ When will he be able to write?
L371408 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
L371407 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Never mind. Forget it.
L371403 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
L371402 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
L371364 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
L371363 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
L371250 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
L371249 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Y'all just act natural.
L371215 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What do you think, Trapper?
L371214 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
L371213 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
L371206 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Call Dago Red.
L371205 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
L371203 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
L371202 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
L371199 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.
L371198 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
L371197 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
L371191 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...
L371190 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Sixteen times.
L371189 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
L371151 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ And it's the ninth inning.
L371150 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
L371149 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
L371148 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ The chest-cutter.
L371147 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What's that?
L371146 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Except we forgot one other small thing.
L371145 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ No, Hawkeye just said it all.
L371137 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
L371136 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
L371110 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ We been had.
L371109 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
L371094 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
L371093 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ He can't take much more time on the table.
L371092 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
L371062 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
L371061 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
L371055 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.
L371054 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
L371053 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
L371019 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
L371018 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
L371007 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
L371006 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
L371005 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
L371004 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Well, there it is. Jesus!
L371002 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
L371001 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore   House. You in the market Duke?
L371000 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
L370999 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
L370997 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.
L370996 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
L370995 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
L370994 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
L370993 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Crabapple Cove. Maine.
L370992 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
L370991 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
L370990 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
L370989 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Make it yourself, or is it real?
L370988 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I got some.
L370987 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
L370986 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You got directions?
L370985 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Duke Forrest.
L370984 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
L371435 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I can't... couldn't.
L371434 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Wait a second...
L371433 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Don't stop now! Please...
L371432 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Frank...
L371421 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
L371420 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
L371419 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
L371418 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Godless buffoons, all of them.
L371400 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
L371399 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
L371398 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Ravenous. What about you?
L371397 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
L371396 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ We think the same way.
L371395 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We're a good team.
L371394 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ I think it's a marvelous letter.
L371393 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
L371392 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ People will talk.
L371391 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ I have a tent to myself.
L371390 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
L371389 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
L371448 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
L371447 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I was just asking...
L371131 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ ...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.
L371130 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
L371129 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ ...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
L371122 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ ...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
L371121 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
L371120 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Give us this day our daily...
L371106 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
L371105 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Is that liquor?
L371828 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
L371827 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You willing to b-back that up with odds?
L371826 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
L371782 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ N-n-no thanks, G-General.
L371781 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
L371780 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ But what about Major Houlihan?
L371779 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
L371778 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ A football game?
L371777 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
L371759 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
L371758 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
L371757 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
L371756 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I think I heard about that.
L371755 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
L371754 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
L371746 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll tell you what makes him the best C.O. you've got in any of your hospitals. He leaves all the medical decisions to the men who do the day- to-day work and understand what meatball surgery is.
L371745 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
L371744 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ And there it is.
L371743 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ So if it ain't staring us in the face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. And that, along with the look of the wounds, makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it.
L371742 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ Right.
L371741 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
L371740 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
L371739 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
L371735 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
L371734 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ I want to talk to you, Pierce.
L371733 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
L371726 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You betcher ass, General.
L371725 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
L371722 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ What?
L371721 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You betcher ass, Dad.
L371720 +++$+++ u2020 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ GENERAL HAMMOND +++$+++ At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
L371719 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Gimme three.
L371837 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
L371836 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Radar!
L371685 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ I found a doner.
L371684 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I though you said we didn't have a drop.
L371683 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
L371453 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
L371452 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
L371451 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
L371895 +++$+++ u2029 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
L371894 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
L371893 +++$+++ u2029 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ C-A-M-E-M...?
L371892 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
L371891 +++$+++ u2029 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
L371890 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What for?
L371802 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Not necessarily.
L371801 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
L371774 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ He can move in here with us.
L371773 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
L371772 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
L371771 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ So what makes you think he'll play for us?
L371768 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
L371767 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ He only lasted one season.
L371763 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
L371762 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
L371709 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ They're coming.
L371708 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
L371682 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Sure, that's the right way... at John Hopkins or someplace. But how do we know there won't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now? Maybe we won't be able to get to him when we want to. Maybe the goddam thing'll erode the artery when nobody's looking. Our best shot is now.
L371681 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
L371680 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
L371679 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What do we do?
L371678 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
L371677 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I don't get it.
L371676 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
L371675 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Oh, Jesus.
L371674 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I don't feel anything.
L371671 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ If we don't get that pint, he's in trouble.
L371670 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
L371669 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
L371668 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
L371667 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
L371666 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
L371665 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
L371661 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
L371660 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
L371657 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
L371656 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It's in pretty deep.
L371655 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
L371654 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ For you, Trapper.
L371648 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Radar!
L371647 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
L371592 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
L371591 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Is he out?
L371566 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What's the age of consent in this country?
L371565 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
L371564 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
L371557 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.
L371556 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
L371555 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
L371529 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.
L371528 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
L371527 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
L371512 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
L371511 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
L371498 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
L371497 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Look.
L371495 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
L371494 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
L371490 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
L371489 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
L371486 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ 'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
L371485 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
L371474 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
L371473 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
L371417 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
L371416 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ No, no, that one.
L371415 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
L371304 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
L371303 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
L371298 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
L371297 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ We stand behind all our work.
L371281 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ An eternal damnation.
L371280 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
L371273 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
L371272 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
L371263 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
L371262 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Black capsule.
L371218 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
L371217 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ ...But I turned in my knee pads.
L371201 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.
L371200 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
L371193 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
L371192 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
L371188 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ I like an olive.
L371187 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
L371183 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
L371182 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
L371711 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
L371710 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
L371387 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
L371386 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
L371385 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
L371384 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
L371383 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
L371382 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
L371381 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
L371380 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
L371379 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
L371378 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Major Burns is far from satisfied.
L371377 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ That's right. We work well together.
L371376 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ All of them?
L371375 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
L371374 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
L371373 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
L371372 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
L371884 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Hang in there.
L371883 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ It's possible
L371882 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ See you.
L371831 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
L371830 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What's the matter?
L371798 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
L371797 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
L371796 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ I think we could still have a chance.
L371795 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ The bastards outconned us.
L371790 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I'm thinking about how we can make more money.  Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.
L371789 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
L371788 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
L371330 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all.  Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.
L371329 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
L371328 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
L371327 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
L371326 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
L371325 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ You think he won't.
L371324 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
L371323 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
L371322 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
L371321 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It happens to be a matter of life and death.
L371320 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ You're asking for somebody else?
L371319 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I didn't mean with me.
L371318 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
L371317 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
L371316 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
L371315 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
L371314 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
L371313 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ You're on his side all of the sudden?
L371312 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
L371311 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
L371310 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
L371309 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
L371308 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You're leaving tomorrow?
L371307 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
L371165 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Maria...
L371164 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ Even if I weren't.
L371091 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.
L371090 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
L371089 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
L371088 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Of course not.
L371087 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
L371086 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Ayuh.
L371085 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
L371084 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
L371083 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
L371082 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Same here.
L371081 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ Very happily married.
L371080 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Something else we have in common.
L371079 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ But I'm married.
L371078 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You have a certain modest charm yourself.
L371077 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ You're an attractive man.
L371076 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
L371075 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ Our minds?
L371074 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
L371073 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
L371072 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It isn't always this rough?
L371071 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
L371070 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ 'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
L371069 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ How did you get called that?
L371068 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
L371067 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
L371066 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
L371065 +++$+++ u2026 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT DISH +++$+++ Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
L371471 +++$+++ u2025 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ KOREAN DOCTOR +++$+++ Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?
L371470 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Why would he do that?
L371469 +++$+++ u2025 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ KOREAN DOCTOR +++$+++ At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
L371468 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
L371467 +++$+++ u2025 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ KOREAN DOCTOR +++$+++ I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
L371466 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
L371465 +++$+++ u2025 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ KOREAN DOCTOR +++$+++ You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
L371463 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Yeah!
L371462 +++$+++ u2027 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT SCORCH +++$+++ You really say the cutest things.
L371461 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I didn't have much choice.
L371460 +++$+++ u2027 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT SCORCH +++$+++ It was really nice of you to take me along.
L371060 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Duke...
L371059 +++$+++ u2027 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT SCORCH +++$+++ Second pint.
L371058 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
L371913 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Glad to help.
L371912 +++$+++ u2032 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ Thanks.
L371911 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ They missed the boat.
L371910 +++$+++ u2032 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
L371909 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
L371905 +++$+++ u2032 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
L371904 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What do you want with those two medical officers?
L371903 +++$+++ u2032 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ Yes, Reverend?
L371902 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Excuse me, Sergeant.
L371901 +++$+++ u2032 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT +++$+++ Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
L371594 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Let's get his clothes off quick.
L371593 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ He's coming to.
L371581 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
L371580 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What's wrong with him?
L371579 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
L371578 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What's the story?
L371577 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
L371576 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Why can't you look at him?
L371538 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ That's about the only thing I don't do  that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
L371537 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
L371536 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
L371535 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You don't go after the local scrunch?
L371532 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed.  You still working the trains?
L371531 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ The one and only.
L371530 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
L371526 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
L371525 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
L371334 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
L371333 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Morning Painless. How they goin'?
L371302 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
L371301 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
L371300 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ How much time do I have?
L371267 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ You guys got any black capsules?
L371266 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ In the direction you want to go.
L371261 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
L371260 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
L371246 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
L371245 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
L371244 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
L371243 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
L371242 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
L371241 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Just in dreams?
L371240 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ No, never in the slightest.
L371239 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
L371238 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
L371237 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ Homosexuality.
L371236 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
L371235 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
L371234 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
L371233 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
L371232 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...
L371231 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ There's only one worth noticing.
L371230 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
L371229 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Tell me the whole story, Walt.
L371228 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
L371033 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Poker sounds great. When do you play?
L371032 +++$+++ u2030 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ PAINLESS +++$+++ Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
L371861 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.
L371860 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
L371410 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I don't think so either.
L371409 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
L371248 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
L371247 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
L371171 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
L371170 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
L371116 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
L371115 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
L371099 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ That. It's out of the act.
L371098 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ I have not understood what you means.
L371097 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You can cut the bow.
L371096 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
L371792 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
L371791 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
L371646 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
L371645 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
L371371 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
L371370 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ First decent idea you've had in a month.
L371366 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.
L371365 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
L371362 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
L371361 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
L371162 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
L371161 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
L371160 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ About that chest-cutter...
L371159 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
L371158 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
L371144 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
L371143 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
L371140 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Your tent?
L371139 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
L371138 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You don't aim to cause any trouble  But?
L371025 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
L371024 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
L371023 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
L371022 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ The blonde dish.
L371009 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Nope, we're assigned heah.
L371008 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
L371851 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
L371850 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
L371360 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
L371359 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What's wrong with you?
L371357 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
L371356 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
L371353 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ I did. First and only blow. So far.
L371352 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Yes, that's what I mean.
L371351 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ You mean who hit who?
L371350 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What's going on? Who started this?
L371611 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
L371610 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Damn.
L371609 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
L371450 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ I can try, sir.
L371449 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Can you make out what they're talking about?
L371439 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Morning, Captain.
L371438 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ Splendid, sir. No problems.
L371437 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Morning, Radar. How were things?
L371436 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ Good morning, Colonel.
L371044 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ Yes, Colonel.
L371043 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Oh, get out of here!
L371042 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ Sir?
L371041 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Stop that, O'Rielly!
L371040 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
L371039 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
L371038 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ Sir?
L371037 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
L371036 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ Sir?
L370978 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
L370977 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
L370976 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ I'm afraid so, Colonel.
L370975 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
L370974 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Yes, dammit, and...
L370973 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
L370972 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
L370971 +++$+++ u2031 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ RADAR +++$+++ Yes, sir?
L370970 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ O'Reilly!
L371856 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I out-coached that General Hammond.
L371855 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ What's that, Henry?
L371854 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Well, there's one big satisfaction.
L371794 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ They can't do that to me!

L371787 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ I used to throw the javelin.
L371786 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
L371785 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
L371784 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
L371783 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
L371616 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Listen, we get a deluge like this, just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough. So never mind the side issues.
L371615 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
L371614 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Yeah?

L371612 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
L371442 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Good morning.
L371441 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Morning, girls. Good morning Major.

L371582 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
L371575 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Now?
L371574 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
L371571 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ How can I taste it now? We've already had like twelve courses.
L371570 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
L371569 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
L371547 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.
L371546 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
L371545 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Never mind.
L371543 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ That bad?  But I guess you're right. We might as well see him.  Got any caddie carts?

L371803 +++$+++ u2035 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ UGLY JOHN +++$+++ As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
L371691 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Boys, we're home free.
L371690 +++$+++ u2035 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ UGLY JOHN +++$+++ Nice.
L371689 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?

L423657 +++$+++ u2375 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
L423656 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
L423649 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ So she did witness it?
L423648 +++$+++ u2375 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
L423647 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Could I have that in American?

L423715 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
L423714 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
L423344 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
L423343 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...I meant your food.
L423342 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
L423341 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
L424554 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
L424553 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
L424552 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
L424549 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ You gotta go, we're pinned down!
L424548 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
L424547 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
L424538 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
L424537 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
L424504 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ -- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
L424503 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
L424502 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
L424248 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I know plenty.
L424247 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
L424246 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Little place called "Williams," why?
L424245 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Any idea where it is?
L424244 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ What about it?
L424243 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
L424242 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
L424241 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ That's a nice name for what you need...
L424240 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
L424091 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ No, I didn't have to.
L424090 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
L424089 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
L424088 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Well, do something, then, damnit!
L424087 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ I know that...
L424086 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
L423867 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ She said she was in Arizona, did she?
L423866 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
L423863 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
L423862 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
L423860 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Tell him what you told me.
L423859 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
L423858 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
L423855 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
L423854 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ We think we know where Betty is.
L423853 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
L423728 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
L423727 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
L423726 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
L423725 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You're lying!
L423724 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
L423723 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
L423655 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
L423654 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
L423653 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
L423652 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Oww, the arm, the arm!
L423651 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
L423650 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
L423644 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ 'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it.
L423643 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
L423642 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ A woman can write a check.
L423641 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You said a woman couldn't have done it.
L423640 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
L423639 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Anyway, so what?
L423638 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Junior year!
L423637 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ ...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
L423636 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
L423635 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Yeah?
L423634 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ I questioned Joyce about all this...
L423614 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
L423613 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
L423612 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Bad idea...
L423611 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
L423610 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Did you send anyone out there?
L423609 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
L423608 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
L423606 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ You think a woman did that?!
L423605 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Jesus...
L423604 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
L423603 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
L423602 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ It wasn't a woman.
L423601 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
L423600 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
L423599 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ No, Elden, I need to...
L423598 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ ...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
L423597 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
L423596 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
L423595 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
L423594 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
L423593 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Oww! My arm, careful!
L423592 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
L423354 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
L423353 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
L423352 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ ...plenty
L423351 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
L423350 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
L423348 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
L423347 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You should get the order you want.
L423346 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ It's fine. Mind your own meal...
L423345 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I thought you said the eggs weren't...
L423340 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty...
L423339 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
L423338 +++$+++ u2368 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BALLARD +++$+++ Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
L423413 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Uh-huh.  Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels.
L423412 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ 'Kay, good. Bye, then...
L423411 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
L423410 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
L423409 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ You must be joking.
L423408 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ They're fine... you miss it?
L423407 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
L423406 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh. How come?
L423405 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Great. Good. Content...
L423404 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, I was just... How you doing?
L423403 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Need something else?
L423401 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.
L423400 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ "Banners?"
L423399 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
L424570 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't think I am.
L424569 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
L424568 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
L424567 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
L424566 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
L424565 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
L424564 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
L424563 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...what're you saying?
L424562 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
L424561 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'd rather not...
L424560 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
L424559 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ This is really awkward...
L424558 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
L424557 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I better go check on them.
L424556 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
L424544 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
L424543 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
L424542 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L424541 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's my son! My son is dead!
L424528 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
L424527 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
L424526 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
L424525 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
L424524 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
L424523 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
L424522 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
L424521 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ "Thirty-two?"
L424520 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
L424519 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Umm, I don't think that...
L424518 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
L424517 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
L424516 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I am?
L424515 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
L424496 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...to see you.
L424495 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
L424494 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
L424493 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
L424492 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
L424491 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
L424490 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
L424489 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
L424488 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Do you know why I'm here?
L424487 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...I... I know what you are.
L424486 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Do you know who I am?
L424485 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
L424484 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
L424477 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh, this is wonderful...
L424476 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
L424475 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Who are these idiots?
L423945 +++$+++ u2372 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHIEF NURSE +++$+++ Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
L423944 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Umm... yes. Back home.
L423943 +++$+++ u2372 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHIEF NURSE +++$+++ You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
L423942 +++$+++ u2372 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHIEF NURSE +++$+++ Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?  Fine...
L423941 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L423940 +++$+++ u2372 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHIEF NURSE +++$+++ What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
L423898 +++$+++ u2372 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHIEF NURSE +++$+++ Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
L423897 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
L423896 +++$+++ u2372 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHIEF NURSE +++$+++ ...I don't think I know that hospital.
L423895 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
L423894 +++$+++ u2372 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHIEF NURSE +++$+++ Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
L423893 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
L423892 +++$+++ u2372 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHIEF NURSE +++$+++ Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
L423794 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
L423793 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I gotta go.
L423792 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Do what?
L423791 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
L423790 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L423789 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
L423788 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
L423787 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
L423669 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
L423668 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
L423667 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
L423666 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Well, you are.
L423665 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ All the time...
L423664 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
L423663 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
L423662 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
L423661 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Are you and Larry happy?
L423660 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Let me know if you need anything, okay?
L423437 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I gotta go make dinner.
L423436 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
L423435 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yeah, me too.
L423434 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
L423433 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
L423432 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ What?
L423431 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Maroon.  I stole it.
L423430 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ The LeSabre!
L423429 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What?
L423428 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Aahhh...  So what color is it?
L423427 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
L423426 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ You sure? Maybe next week we could...
L423425 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's all right.
L423424 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
L423423 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No... what about your sister?
L423422 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
L423421 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
L423420 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Oh, Betty --
L423419 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
L423418 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
L423417 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Did you watch it yet?
L424594 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
L424593 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Thanks...
L424592 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
L424591 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ George...
L424590 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
L424589 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I have... did it sound that bad?
L424588 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
L424587 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
L424586 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
L424585 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh. Of course... sorry.
L424392 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
L424391 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
L424390 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
L424389 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
L424386 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ ...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
L424385 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
L424382 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
L424381 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ David, please --
L424380 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
L424379 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What do you mean? What did I do to you...
L424378 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
L424369 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
L424368 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Why are you doing this to me?
L424367 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
L424366 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
L424355 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
L424354 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Ad lib?
L424353 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
L424325 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes... maybe it was.
L424324 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
L424323 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
L424322 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
L424321 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
L424320 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
L424319 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
L424318 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
L424317 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No, I mean your dedication scares me...
L424316 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
L424315 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
L424314 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
L424313 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Didn't I?
L424312 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
L424310 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
L424309 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
L424308 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't think your friend likes me.
L424223 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I know. It's up to us.
L424222 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
L424221 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Of course.
L424220 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
L424219 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I just want everything to be perfect between us.
L424218 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
L424217 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
L424216 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What happened when you were twelve?
L424215 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
L424214 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You told me that two hours ago.
L424213 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
L424212 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
L424211 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
L424210 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
L424209 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes, she is.
L424208 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Lyla's very nice.
L424184 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're late, Eric.
L424183 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
L424182 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
L424181 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
L424159 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
L424158 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Why do they keep calling you George?
L424155 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
L424154 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You never gave us a chance...
L424153 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
L424152 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
L424148 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
L424147 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
L424146 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You knew Del?!
L424145 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
L424144 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, Del.
L424143 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh, you mean Fred.
L424129 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
L424128 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That's very kind of you.
L424127 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
L424126 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L424124 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ We were engaged.
L424123 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I take it I should. I'm sorry.
L424122 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
L424416 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
L424415 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't know.
L424414 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
L424413 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
L424412 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
L424411 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I came for love...
L424410 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
L423458 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ That is a skill!
L423457 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
L423456 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
L423454 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ They're new to us...
L423453 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
L423452 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
L423451 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
L423450 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
L423449 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ ...well, then you ain't got much.
L423448 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I got you, Del...
L423447 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
L423446 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Or the vitamins? Or the...?
L423445 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ What?
L423444 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...like the water purifiers?
L423443 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
L423442 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
L423441 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
L423440 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
L423439 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
L423438 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Sure you don't want any salad?
L423396 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
L423395 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What was that?
L423393 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ What's so special about it?
L423392 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
L423391 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ I ran back in to get the phone.
L423390 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
L423389 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
L423388 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ So, call me when you --
L424471 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's not really a good time, guys...
L424470 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
L424466 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
L424465 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Ahh, look, right now's not very...
L424464 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You're in serious danger!
L424463 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Roy! What are you doing here?
L424462 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
L423588 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It was Chloe...
L423587 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You did? Was it anyone that you...?
L423586 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes.
L423585 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ My God... did you get a look at who did it?
L423584 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
L423583 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
L423582 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What're you doing here, Roy?
L423581 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
L423580 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L423579 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Make sure it's elevated...
L423578 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
L423577 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
L423576 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
L423337 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
L423336 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
L423335 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
L423834 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
L423833 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
L423832 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
L423831 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
L423830 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You made out alright.
L423829 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Worse.
L423828 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Like Rome?
L423827 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
L423826 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'll go to the Hospital.
L423825 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
L423823 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
L423822 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ You mean... George McCord, the actor?
L423821 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Dr. David Ravell.
L423820 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ What's his real name?
L423819 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ How did you know?
L423818 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
L423817 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No. Loma Vista.
L423816 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
L423815 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
L423814 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
L423813 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
L423812 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Really?
L423811 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I left my husband two days ago.
L423810 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.
L423809 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ That's horrible!
L423808 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
L423807 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Sure I loved it! It was great.
L423806 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Did you love it?
L423805 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
L423804 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
L423803 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
L423802 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Los Angeles, California.
L423801 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Where you headed, Betty?
L423800 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
L423799 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'd slap his face.
L423798 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
L423786 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
L423785 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Shut up, Merle... Williams.
L423778 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
L423777 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
L423776 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
L423775 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I begged him to let me put that on!
L423774 +++$+++ u2378 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ What's the matter here?
L424388 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...did I win some contest?
L424387 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ She called you 'George,' George.
L424139 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I married a car salesman.
L424138 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
L424137 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
L424133 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
L424132 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
L424131 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
L424456 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
L424455 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ These guys are here to help you, Betty.
L424435 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise.
L424434 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
L424433 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
L424432 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
L424431 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ What?! That you had something to do with it?
L424429 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
L424428 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Your husband?!
L424427 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
L424426 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
L424425 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I have to leave now.
L424424 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Where are you going?
L424423 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...this is your sweater, right?
L424422 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
L424421 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ What are you doing?
L424307 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh, he does that.  It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
L424306 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
L424305 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Rosa, so you've met David?
L424301 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
L424300 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
L424299 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You should have a little faith in people.
L424298 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
L424297 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Rosa...
L424296 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
L424295 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Are you sure I can borrow this?
L424239 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
L424238 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, almost never.
L424237 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
L424236 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
L424235 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
L424234 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
L424233 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
L424232 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
L424231 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
L424230 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
L424229 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He is real.
L424228 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Does he know you think he's real?
L424227 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ You still in love?
L424226 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
L424225 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Were you with him this whole time?
L424118 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ You never know who you'll see.
L424117 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Looking for someone?
L424101 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Umm...
L424100 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
L424099 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What are those for?
L424098 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ ...okay.
L424097 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ So what do you say? Can we be friends?
L424096 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
L424095 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
L424070 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Fine.
L424069 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
L424067 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ HE IS REAL!!
L424066 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
L424065 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Why'd you help me in the first place?
L424063 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
L424062 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
L424061 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
L424060 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Shhh! I heard you the first time.
L424059 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
L424058 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I have no idea what you're talking about.
L424057 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
L424056 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!
L424055 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What? Where was he?!
L424054 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Doctor David Ravell.
L424053 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Who?
L424052 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Guess who I saw today.
L424022 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ I was talking about what you could wear!
L424021 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You said in L.A., anything goes.
L424020 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
L424019 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ How many men have I talked to?
L424018 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
L424017 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
L424016 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
L424015 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
L424014 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ ...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
L424013 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
L424012 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
L424011 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
L424010 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
L424009 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ God, that's awful!
L424008 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
L424007 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ He has a wife?!
L424006 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
L424005 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
L424004 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
L424003 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
L424002 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
L424001 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
L424000 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
L423999 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
L423998 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ The Five?
L423997 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
L423996 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
L423975 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
L423974 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
L423973 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
L423972 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
L423971 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
L423970 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ The one you were telling me about?
L423969 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ I got this apartment with a guy.
L423967 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
L423966 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, that's not, I couldn't...
L423965 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
L423962 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Man, that is love.
L423961 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
L423960 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ 'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
L423959 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's something I had to do. For David.
L423956 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I came for love. My fianc is here.
L423955 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ So why'd you come to L.A.?
L423954 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
L423953 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ You don't sound like you're from here.
L423917 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
L423916 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
L423915 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
L423914 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ You're hurting him!!
L423913 +++$+++ u2369 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He has no heartbeat!
L423912 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ What are you doing?
L423362 +++$+++ u2370 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BLAKE +++$+++ No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
L423361 +++$+++ u2383 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LONNIE +++$+++ I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
L423360 +++$+++ u2370 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BLAKE +++$+++ Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
L423359 +++$+++ u2383 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LONNIE +++$+++ Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
L423358 +++$+++ u2370 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ BLAKE +++$+++ We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
L423357 +++$+++ u2383 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LONNIE +++$+++ Blake, I can handle that transplant!
L424401 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Good.
L424400 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, that should be more than --
L424399 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ More than you know. Is there anything else?
L424398 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
L424397 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
L424396 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Deranged. That would be the right word.
L424395 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
L424394 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What can I do for you, gentlemen?
L423689 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
L423688 +++$+++ u2376 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ Really. And where was that, old man?
L423687 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
L423686 +++$+++ u2376 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ He goin' crazy on us, or what?
L423685 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
L423684 +++$+++ u2376 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ The fuck you talking about?
L423683 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
L423682 +++$+++ u2376 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ Huh?
L423681 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
L423680 +++$+++ u2376 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
L423677 +++$+++ u2376 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
L423676 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
L423534 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...and put them in your mouth.
L423533 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
L423530 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ My socks?
L423529 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
L423528 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ I... I don't know...
L423527 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
L423526 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
L423525 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Like what?
L423524 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
L423523 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
L423515 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?
L423514 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
L423511 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Are we gonna do business here, or not?
L423510 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
L423509 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ No...
L423508 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
L423507 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ I don't follow...
L423506 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
L423505 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Of what?
L423504 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Could you give us an example?
L423501 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
L423500 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L423497 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Are you kidding me? What's to like?
L423496 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
L423495 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Fine. You got five...
L423494 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
L423491 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
L423490 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ If we're for real?
L423489 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
L423484 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Ahh... my wife's.
L423483 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
L423482 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
L423481 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh, yes, with the coffee...
L423480 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
L423472 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
L423471 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ ...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
L424459 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ What's wrong with you?
L424458 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
L424448 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
L424447 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
L424446 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
L424445 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ ...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
L424444 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
L424443 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
L424442 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
L424440 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
L424439 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ You were right. Del wasn't lying.
L424340 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You made your point...  I was wrong.
L424339 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ ...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
L424338 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I said 'got it?'
L424337 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Man, you have got to get some therapy.
L424336 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
L424335 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
L424334 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
L424333 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ ...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
L424332 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
L424331 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
L424330 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It just didn't fit her profile...
L424329 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
L424328 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ A doctor on the show... why?
L424327 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Who's this?
L424281 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ "It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
L424280 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Wesley...
L424279 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
L424278 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You need to remember who you're talking to...
L424277 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
L424276 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ 'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
L424275 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
L424274 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I never said that I believed...
L424273 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
L424272 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What doesn't?
L424271 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
L424270 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
L424269 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
L424268 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
L424267 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Well... I think I saw her soul.
L424266 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ So you believed the bartender. Why?
L424192 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
L424191 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
L424175 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
L424174 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What?
L424173 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I'm not telling.
L424172 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Where? Where is she?
L424171 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
L424114 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
L424113 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
L424112 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
L424111 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ "When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
L424110 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I said, 'No.' N-O.
L424109 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
L424108 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
L424107 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
L424106 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ No.
L424105 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's a very moving experience, trust me.
L424104 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
L424103 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ We should go.
L424038 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
L424037 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
L424036 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ How'd they describe her?
L424031 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
L424030 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
L424029 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
L424027 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
L424026 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That was a really shitty thing to do.
L424025 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ What the hell's the matter with you?
L424024 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
L423989 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
L423988 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Worse... you're in Texas.
L423987 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
L423986 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
L423985 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I know that.
L423984 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
L423983 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain.  They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!
L423982 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ They paid us half. They still owe us half...
L423981 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What?
L423980 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Half.
L423979 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
L423938 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
L423937 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
L423934 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
L423933 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
L423927 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
L423926 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
L423925 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
L423924 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
L423880 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
L423879 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
L423852 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
L423851 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Like... us?
L423850 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
L423849 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ So what the fuck's a Finn?
L423848 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Betty, Betty, Betty...
L423847 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
L423846 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
L423845 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
L423841 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
L423840 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
L423839 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ ...among others.
L423838 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Joyce was screwing Del.
L423837 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
L423836 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
L423737 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ ...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
L423736 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I hope you're right...
L423735 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
L423734 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
L423730 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
L423729 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
L423709 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
L423708 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
L423707 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What the hell was that, another statement?
L423702 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
L423701 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Should I kill him now?
L423700 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
L423695 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
L423694 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
L423679 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
L423678 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ We can live with that.
L423674 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
L423673 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
L423629 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
L423628 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ ...that's a good motto.
L423627 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
L423626 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I wanted to make a statement.
L423625 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
L423624 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
L423623 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's not here. Let's go.
L423622 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
L423621 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
L423620 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
L423619 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
L423618 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What 'look'?
L423617 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I didn't. You gave me a look!
L423616 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
L423615 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
L423570 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
L423569 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Well, why'd you shoot him?
L423568 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ We don't know which Buick, do we?
L423567 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ He told us it's in the Buick.
L423566 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
L423565 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you?
L423564 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ You told me how to do it!
L423563 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
L423560 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ IT SURE IS!!
L423559 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
L423549 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ A mark, huh?
L423548 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
L423546 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
L423545 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Hell of a way to die.
L423544 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
L423542 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
L423541 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Now, that's really stupid.
L423540 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
L423539 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ That is so right.
L423538 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
L423537 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ That's right.
L423517 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
L423516 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
L423513 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
L423512 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Relax, we brought the cash.
L423479 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
L423478 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Hey... you got a fine one right here!
L423476 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Beer, please.
L423475 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Bourbon, little water, thank you.
L423884 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
L423883 +++$+++ u2377 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
L423882 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L423881 +++$+++ u2377 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
L423875 +++$+++ u2377 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Betty was a lovely child.
L423874 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Very graceful. Perfect form.
L423873 +++$+++ u2377 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ This is Betty at twelve.
L423759 +++$+++ u2373 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DARLENE +++$+++ ...who doesn't?
L423758 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
L423757 +++$+++ u2373 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DARLENE +++$+++ If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
L423756 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I see.  May I?
L423755 +++$+++ u2373 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DARLENE +++$+++ No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
L423754 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ But she wanted more out of life, right?
L423753 +++$+++ u2373 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DARLENE +++$+++ Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
L423752 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hmm... you two in high school together?
L423751 +++$+++ u2373 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DARLENE +++$+++ Oh, five years, give or take.
L423750 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...and how long did she work here?
L423522 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ "Injuns?"
L423521 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
L423520 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ He's waiting...
L423519 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Jesus Christ!
L423503 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ You better believe it.
L423502 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Really?
L423499 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ It is, if you like idiots...
L423498 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Seems like a nice place.
L423493 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
L423492 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Isn't that the point?
L423486 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
L423485 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ What'd you get her?
L424580 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Then do as you're told. Get her back.
L424579 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
L424578 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
L424577 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
L424576 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
L424575 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
L424574 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
L424573 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
L424377 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I SAID FORGET IT!
L424376 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
L424373 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No! Let me try this!
L424372 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
L424371 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
L424370 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Is there a problem, George?
L424365 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
L424364 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ What the hell's going on?
L424363 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
L424265 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ ...yeah.
L424264 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ "Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
L424263 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hmm?
L424262 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
L424261 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
L424260 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I said I'll think about it.
L424259 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
L424258 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I'll think about it.
L424257 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
L424256 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I don't know, George...
L424255 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
L424254 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
L424253 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Can I have an evil twin?
L424252 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ We know that...
L424251 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
L424250 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
L424249 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
L424162 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
L424161 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
L424150 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
L424149 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
L424136 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"?
L424135 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
L424134 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
L424292 +++$+++ u2380 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Sure.
L424291 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
L424290 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Oh fuck...
L424289 +++$+++ u2380 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Better.
L424288 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
L424287 +++$+++ u2380 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L424286 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Yeah? The sport utility?
L424285 +++$+++ u2380 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
L424284 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ ...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
L423888 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
L423887 +++$+++ u2381 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JERROLD +++$+++ Because it ain't natural, young man.
L423886 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ ...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
L423885 +++$+++ u2381 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JERROLD +++$+++ You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
L423878 +++$+++ u2381 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JERROLD +++$+++ Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
L423877 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Would you say she was ambitious?
L423876 +++$+++ u2381 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JERROLD +++$+++ And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
L424084 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...
L424083 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Yeah. Why, you know him?
L424082 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
L424081 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
L424080 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ What did you say?
L424079 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
L424078 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
L424077 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up, will ya, I got a date tonight...
L424076 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
L424075 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ No... before that.
L424074 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
L424073 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
L424072 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
L424071 +++$+++ u2382 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ JOYCE +++$+++ You're wastin' your time, Roy.
L424093 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
L424092 +++$+++ u2385 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
L424051 +++$+++ u2385 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
L424050 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
L424049 +++$+++ u2385 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
L424048 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ David Ravell.
L424047 +++$+++ u2385 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
L424046 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
L424045 +++$+++ u2385 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
L424044 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
L424043 +++$+++ u2385 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
L424042 +++$+++ u2386 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROSA +++$+++ Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
L424041 +++$+++ u2385 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
L424512 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I swear to God!
L424511 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ You lie, motherfucker...
L424510 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ She's a lesbian.
L424509 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
L424508 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
L424507 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Did Chloe crack?
L424506 +++$+++ u2387 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
L424505 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
L424169 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
L424168 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
L424167 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
L424166 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Huh?
L424165 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ Mr. Campbell?
L424164 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Yeah?
L423749 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
L423748 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
L423747 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I see.  Did Chloe testify?
L423746 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ "A Reason to Love."
L423745 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Her show?
L423744 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
L423743 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
L423742 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
L423741 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
L423740 +++$+++ u2388 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ SUE ANN +++$+++ I wish I could help you, but I can't.
L423739 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
L465827 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
L465826 +++$+++ u2608 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Yes.
L465825 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
L465824 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
L465823 +++$+++ u2608 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
L465822 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Thanks, don't mind if I do.
L465821 +++$+++ u2608 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
L465820 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Now where were we?
L465819 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Alone at last.
L465761 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
L465760 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ I don't wanna lift crates.
L465757 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to-goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin' back before ten o'clock curfew.
L465756 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You're coming back to work for us, right?
L465755 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
L465754 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
L465753 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ Seymour Scagnetti.
L465749 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
L465748 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
L465747 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
L465746 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
L465745 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
L465744 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ You fuckin' wish.
L465737 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
L465736 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ That I should've picked you up?
L465735 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
L465734 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
L465733 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ Fine, now.
L465732 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How ya doin', Toothpick?
L466024 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
L466023 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
L466018 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ How do you know all this?
L466017 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ The motherfucker killed Vic.
L465995 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
L465994 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
L465949 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Was he all pissed off?
L465948 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
L465935 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No. She was from Ladora Heights.
L465934 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Where was she from, Compton?
L465933 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
L465932 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Elois?
L465931 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
L465797 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?
L465796 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Who?
L465795 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'll call somebody.
L465794 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You ain't dying, he is.
L465793 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
L465778 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
L465777 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
L466004 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That's okay, Eddie, I do.
L466003 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
L465768 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.
L465767 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
L465766 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
L465763 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
L465762 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
L465759 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
L465758 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We can work this out, can't we?
L465752 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Really? Who's your P.O.?
L465751 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
L465743 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me.
L465742 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What?
L465741 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Daddy, did ya see that?
L465997 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
L465996 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
L465942 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so things to her.
L465941 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
L465940 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
L465939 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Pam Grier.
L465938 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
L465937 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
L465936 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
L465926 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
L465925 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
L465818 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
L465817 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
L465816 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
L465805 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
L465804 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
L465803 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
L465802 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
L465801 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
L465799 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
L465798 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
L465788 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
L465787 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I don't know, but somebody did.
L465786 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
L465785 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
L465784 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
L465783 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
L465782 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Bullshit.
L465781 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ The cops were there waitin' for us!
L465780 +++$+++ u2609 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What? Nobody set anybody up.
L465779 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
L465909 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
L465908 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ Tell me more about Cabot.
L465887 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
L465886 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I can do that.
L465885 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
L465884 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I gotta memorize all this shit?
L465883 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
L465882 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What?
L465881 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
L465880 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ But what is this?
L465879 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
L465878 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What?
L465877 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ It's a scene. Memorize it.
L465876 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What's this?
L465875 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
L465874 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ Didja use the commode story?
L465872 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
L465871 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
L465870 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
L465869 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
L465868 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ The Milwaukee Brewers?
L465867 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ The Brewers.
L465866 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ What about?
L465865 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ A little.
L465864 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ Yeah.
L465863 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Me and Mr. White?
L465862 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ Did the two of you talk?
L465861 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
L465860 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ How can you tell?
L465859 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
L465858 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ Yeah.
L465857 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Who, Mr. White?
L465856 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ You ever seen this motherfucker before?
L465855 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
L465854 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ ...What bar?
L465853 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
L465848 +++$+++ u2611 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ HOLDAWAY +++$+++ This better not be some Freddy joke.
L465847 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
L465985 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
L465984 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Just hold on buddy boy.
L465981 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What? Snap out of it!
L465980 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L465974 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco.
L465973 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
L465972 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Myself and Mr. Pink?
L465971 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
L465970 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
L465969 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
L465968 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Mr. Brown?
L465967 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
L465966 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Let's go over it. Where are you?
L465947 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You can do some crazy things with it.
L465946 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Jesus Christ!
L465892 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail. She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed. Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin' me, keeps askin' me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station.
L465891 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What for?
L465890 +++$+++ u2610 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ ...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
L465765 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
L465764 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
L465729 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.
L465728 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
L465727 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
L465726 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
L465725 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
L465724 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick.
L465723 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
L465722 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ How is he?
L465721 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
L465720 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Who's your parole officer?
L465719 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Take a seat.
L465718 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ Sure.
L465717 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
L465716 +++$+++ u2620 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ It's a change.
L465715 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
L465418 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
L465417 +++$+++ u2615 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BROWN +++$+++ Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
L465416 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Wong?
L465415 +++$+++ u2615 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BROWN +++$+++ It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."
L465414 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Chew? Toby Chew? No.
L465413 +++$+++ u2615 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BROWN +++$+++ Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
L465405 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
L465404 +++$+++ u2615 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BROWN +++$+++ Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
L465398 +++$+++ u2615 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BROWN +++$+++ It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
L465397 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
L466016 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Dead as Dillinger.
L466015 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Mr. Blue's dead?
L465964 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
L465963 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
L465960 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
L465959 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
L465957 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
L465956 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Why can't we pick out our own colors?
L465955 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Cause you're a faggot, alright?
L465954 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Why am I Mr. Pink?
L465953 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
L465495 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
L465494 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
L466032 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm not askin', I'm betting.
L466031 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Don't ask me that.
L466030 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
L466029 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
L466028 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
L466026 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
L466025 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
L466021 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.
L466020 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ That's your proof?
L466019 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
L466014 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
L466013 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
L466012 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Like hell I am.
L466011 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
L466006 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
L466005 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What the fuck are you talking about?
L465615 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Juicy, junior, real juicy.
L465614 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What's the cut, poppa?
L465613 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ No, they're not.
L465612 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
L465611 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ How many employees?
L465610 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
L465609 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
L465608 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What for?
L465607 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
L465606 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
L465605 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
L465604 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
L465603 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
L465602 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What's she doin' now?
L465450 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
L465449 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Sorry, it's my book now.
L465448 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
L465442 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Who gives a damn?
L465441 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
L465429 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
L465428 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
L465427 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You gonna put it away?
L465426 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Give me my book.
L465425 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
L465424 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What do you care?
L465423 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
L465422 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
L465421 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
L465420 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
L465419 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Give me this fucking thing.
L465407 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
L465406 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What's that?
L466010 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
L466009 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Aren't you?
L465493 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Shut up!  Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast.
L465492 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Nope.
L465491 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
L465490 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ He don't believe in it.
L465489 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
L465488 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ He don't tip.
L465487 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Mr. Pink?  Why?
L465486 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Mr. Pink.
L465485 +++$+++ u2612 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
L465846 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
L465845 +++$+++ u2613 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MARVIN +++$+++ What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
L465844 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
L465843 +++$+++ u2613 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MARVIN +++$+++ That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
L465841 +++$+++ u2613 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MARVIN +++$+++ I do.  How do I look?
L465840 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Shit. I don't remember that at all.
L465839 +++$+++ u2613 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MARVIN +++$+++ Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
L465838 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Freddy Newendyke.
L465837 +++$+++ u2613 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MARVIN +++$+++ Your name's Freddy something.
L465836 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ You do?
L465835 +++$+++ u2613 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MARVIN +++$+++ I know.
L465815 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ I don't like alarms.
L465814 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
L465813 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
L465810 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ He's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery.  What are you, a silent partner? Fuckin' tell him.
L465809 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
L465808 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
L465708 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
L465707 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
L465706 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ You didn't ask.
L465705 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
L465702 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Nice Guy Eddie.
L465701 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ For what, the cops?
L465698 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ It's a surprise.
L465697 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Why?
L465696 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Down to my car.
L465695 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Follow you where?
L465686 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
L465685 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
L465684 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
L465683 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
L465682 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
L465681 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
L465680 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ What're you talkin' about?
L465679 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
L465678 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ What's this guy's problem?
L465668 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ We think we got a rat in the house.
L465667 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ So, talk.
L465431 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
L465430 +++$+++ u2614 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. BLONDE +++$+++ Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
L465993 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
L465992 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
L465988 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
L465987 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What happened?
L465521 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.
L465520 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Lie back down, and try to -
L465519 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
L465518 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I can' take you to a hospital.
L465517 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
L465516 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ It's not good...
L465515 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
L465514 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
L465513 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
L465511 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
L465510 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
L465508 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Bet your sweet ass we are.
L465507 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ Joe.
L465506 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
L465505 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Correct.
L465504 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ I'm okay.
L465503 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
L465501 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ No, I'm not!
L465500 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
L465499 +++$+++ u2616 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. ORANGE +++$+++ All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
L465498 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
L465471 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
L465470 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
L465466 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
L465465 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ I'd go over twelve percent for that.
L465461 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
L465460 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
L465456 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ You don't believe in tipping?
L465455 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I don't believe in it.
L465454 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
L465453 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Uh-uh. I don't tip.
L465452 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ C'mon, throw in a buck.
L465436 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
L465435 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
L465434 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
L465433 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
L465432 +++$+++ u2619 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ NICE GUY EDDIE +++$+++ Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
L465962 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
L465961 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
L465930 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Yeah, those guys too.
L465929 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Not these guys.
L465928 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
L465927 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
L465924 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ There's a slight difference.
L465923 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ ...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
L465812 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ This is what he was doin'.
L465811 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
L465792 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What are you gonna do about him?
L465791 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I told ya he'd be pissed.
L465693 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit...  And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy...  And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.
L465692 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You takin' his side?
L465691 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
L465690 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
L465689 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
L465688 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ So you wanna git bit, huh?
L465687 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
L465673 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.
L465672 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ We don't think this place is safe.
L465671 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Is that supposed to be funny?
L465666 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
L465665 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
L465655 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
L465654 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
L465651 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ That fuckin did it!
L465650 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
L465649 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ If we don't, he'll die.
L465648 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ We ain't taking him to a hospital.
L465647 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ If I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round.
L465646 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
L465645 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Of course.
L465644 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
L465643 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Don't fuckin' patronize me.
L465642 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
L465641 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
L465640 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ He asked.
L465639 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
L465638 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
L465637 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Why!
L465636 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
L465635 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
L465634 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Well, he knows a little about me.
L465633 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
L465632 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I don't know anybody.
L465631 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
L465630 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
L465629 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
L465628 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
L465627 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ You gotta idea, spit it out.
L465626 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
L465625 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
L465624 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
L465623 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ We can't take him to a hospital.
L465622 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
L465621 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.
L465620 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I think he's just passed out.
L465619 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ So what is it?
L465618 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ He ain't dead.
L465617 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ So, is he dead or what?
L465597 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
L465596 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
L465595 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
L465594 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
L465593 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
L465592 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ For all I know, you're the rat.
L465591 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
L465590 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
L465589 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
L465588 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
L465587 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ No shit?
L465586 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
L465585 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ What?
L465584 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
L465583 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
L465582 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ That was the plan, we meet here.
L465581 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
L465580 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Where? Are they out in the car?
L465579 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I got 'em, all right?
L465578 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Where?
L465577 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I got the diamonds.
L465576 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ How can you be so sure?
L465575 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Nope.
L465574 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
L465573 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
L465572 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
L465571 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
L465570 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What do you think?
L465569 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
L465568 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
L465567 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
L465566 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
L465565 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
L465564 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
L465563 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
L465562 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
L465561 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
L465560 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Uh-uh, just cops.
L465559 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ No real people?
L465558 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ A few cops.
L465557 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
L465554 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.
L465553 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
L465552 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
L465551 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
L465550 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
L465549 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
L465548 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
L465547 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What's wrong with it?
L465546 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ That's not correct.
L465545 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
L465544 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Why not?
L465543 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Want a smoke?
L465541 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
L465540 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ I'm cool.
L465539 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
L465538 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
L465537 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Let's go in the other room...
L465536 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
L465535 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
L465534 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
L465533 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You really think we were set up?
L465532 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
L465531 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ As opposed to good?
L465530 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
L465529 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
L465528 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
L465527 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Dead.
L465526 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
L465525 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Gun shot.
L465482 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Fuck all that.
L465481 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
L465477 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.
L465476 +++$+++ u2618 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. WHITE +++$+++ You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
L465475 +++$+++ u2617 +++$+++ m170 +++$+++ MR. PINK +++$+++ Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
L589927 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Good morning.
L589926 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
L589879 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Good.
L589878 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
L589875 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ How could I?  I will do my best. After all, you see, I am financially interested.
L589874 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But can't you give me any idea?
L589873 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I fear he may have to.
L589751 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
L589750 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
L589749 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
L589748 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Mr. Gray?
L589747 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
L589746 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I'm Donald Fettes.
L590139 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ It is a pity.
L590138 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
L590132 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
L590131 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
L590125 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
L590124 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
L589830 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
L589829 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ -- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
L589828 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Yes.
L589827 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ You have his promise, then?
L589771 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Of course I will.
L589770 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ Ask this one favor --
L589769 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
L589768 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ Did he tell you about Georgina?
L589767 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
L589766 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
L589765 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I'm only a student.
L589764 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ I want you to help my little girl.
L589763 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ You asked to see me, ma'am?
L590152 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
L590151 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
L590150 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
L590149 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
L590148 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
L590147 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Where can I find him?
L590146 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ He's not home.
L590079 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
L590078 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I've heard of it.
L590077 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
L590076 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ MacFarlane
L590075 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
L590074 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
L590073 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Aye.
L590072 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
L590071 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
L590070 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
L590069 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
L590068 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
L590067 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
L590066 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ I'm cold as ice.
L590065 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
L590064 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
L590063 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
L590062 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ He's a great doctor -- a great man --
L590061 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
L590060 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
L590059 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ You must leave this house.
L590198 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
L590197 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ It was a woman when we put her in.
L590196 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ This is not a woman!
L590185 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
L590184 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Where shall we put it? In the back?
L590181 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Why not? I must have subjects. It's the only way I can teach. It's the only way you can learn. The stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no -- nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as Gray. We can do our own dirty work -- and we must.
L590180 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ No.
L590179 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
L590178 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ You couldn't do that, Doctor.
L590177 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
L590176 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ You've no thought of going there?
L590175 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
L590174 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ They'll be thinking of that, too.
L590173 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
L590172 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
L590171 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ See that, Fettes?
L590165 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Gray -- I'm rid of him --
L590164 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ What?
L590163 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
L590162 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
L590161 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ What's that you say?
L590054 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Don't be a fool.  One can't begin and then stop -- and because that entry of the girl's body is in your hand, you'll do as I say. As for me, I'll tend to Gray.
L590053 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
L590052 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ What do you mean, Fettes?
L590051 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ No.
L590050 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
L589940 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
L589939 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
L589938 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
L589935 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
L589934 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
L589933 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ That's only our duty, Fettes -- that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business.
L589932 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
L589931 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
L589930 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
L589929 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
L589928 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
L589907 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Pulse?
L589906 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ She's unconscious.
L589904 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
L589903 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
L589898 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
L589897 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But, I didn't ask him to kill.
L589896 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Believe it or not.  It's best for you to pretend that you do.  After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it.  That makes you a party to murder.
L589895 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I can't believe that.
L589894 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
L589893 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
L589892 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
L589891 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
L589890 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ We can't be sure of that.
L589889 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Gray killed her.
L589888 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Well --
L589884 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
L589883 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
L589862 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
L589861 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Yes, I suppose so.
L589860 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You see, it is completely out of the question.
L589859 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
L589858 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
L589857 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But you did promise.
L589856 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
L589855 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
L589854 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
L589853 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
L589807 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
L589806 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
L589805 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I remember her.
L589804 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
L589791 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
L589790 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But this woman -- and her son --
L589788 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
L589787 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
L589786 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
L589785 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
L589784 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I don't think I can go on, sir.
L589743 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
L589742 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
L589731 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
L589730 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But Richardson?
L589729 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Well? And are you not a good student?
L589728 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I thought only the best students were made assistants.
L589727 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
L589726 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
L589725 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You're made for a doctor, young man!
L589724 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
L589712 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Excuse me.
L589711 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Dr. MacFarlane --
L589698 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
L589697 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
L589696 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Come in, boy -- come in.
L589695 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
L590143 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ I wanted to see the white horse --
L590142 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ You'll not need that again, Georgina.
L590127 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
L590126 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ I thought this was a school day.
L589937 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ I can't.
L589936 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
L589846 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina.  Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness.  Do you want it that much?
L589845 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ I want it --
L589844 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Aye, but I still wonder how much.
L589842 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
L589841 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
L589840 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
L589839 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ He was a nice horse.
L589838 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
L589835 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ An old acquaintance, eh?
L589834 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
L589833 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Hear him?
L589705 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ Well --
L589704 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Why, yes.
L589703 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
L589701 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors.
L589700 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Not yet.
L589699 +++$+++ u3179 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GEORGINA +++$+++ Are you a doctor, too?
L589668 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --
L589667 +++$+++ u3184 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MACBRIDE +++$+++ A doctor?
L589666 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ I'm by way of being a medical myself.
L589665 +++$+++ u3184 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MACBRIDE +++$+++ They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
L589664 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
L589662 +++$+++ u3178 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ FETTES +++$+++ Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
L589661 +++$+++ u3184 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MACBRIDE +++$+++ He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
L590109 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
L590108 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ A pleasure to torment me?
L590107 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
L590106 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ But why, Gray? Why?
L590105 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
L590104 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
L590102 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Beg -- beg of you! You crawling graveyard rat!
L590101 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
L590100 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I would make you rich.
L590099 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Would you bribe me to leave you be?
L590098 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
L590097 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ The Resurrection business? That may end sooner than you think. New laws may come.
L590096 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I have other means of sustenance.
L590095 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
L590093 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
L590092 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I've drunk enough tonight.
L590091 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
L590090 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ We have never been friends.
L590089 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
L590086 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I can't understand your hurt to me -- but I must cut you out.
L590085 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
L590084 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
L590040 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
L590039 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
L590038 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Get out of here!
L590037 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ This is a gift you'll not return.
L590036 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I take no gifts from you.
L590035 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ This is a gift.
L590034 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I've ordered nothing from you.
L590033 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
L590030 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
L590029 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ What are you going here? Have I not told you --
L589984 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I have no wish for a rope cravat. I've never liked the smell of hemp, so I'll bid you good night, Doctor MacFarlane.
L589983 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
L589982 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
L589981 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!  And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
L589980 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
L589979 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
L589977 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
L589976 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
L589974 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look --
L589973 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ In the brain, I tell you. I know.
L589972 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ But what makes a thought start?
L589971 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ The nerve centers -- the brain --
L589970 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
L589969 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ The heart pumps it.
L589968 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
L589967 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
L589966 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
L589965 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
L589964 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
L589962 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ The same. Look here, Gray --
L589961 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
L589960 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
L589959 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
L589958 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
L589957 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I've had some experience.
L589956 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You know something about the human body, Gray.
L589954 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
L589953 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
L589919 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
L589918 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
L589917 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
L589916 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
L589824 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife?
L589823 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
L589822 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Toddy hates me.
L589820 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ That's a good boy, Toddy.
L589819 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ It might be an interesting case.
L589818 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
L589817 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ No.
L589816 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
L589815 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I'll not do it, Gray.
L589814 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
L589813 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
L589812 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Why don't you do it then?
L589811 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I am the best man for the job.
L589810 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
L589809 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Afraid of what?
L589808 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
L589803 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You will not have it?
L589802 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I will not have you use that name to me.
L589798 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
L589797 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
L589796 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name.  Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
L589795 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Don't call me that confounded name.
L589794 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
L590020 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
L590019 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
L590018 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ "Nor did they handle axe or knife To take away their victim's life -- No sooner done than in a chest They crammed their lately welcome guest."
L590017 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
L590016 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ "A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like."  Ah, how he cozened them.
L590015 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
L590014 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ But where did they get those people?
L590013 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to Dr. Knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small. That's good business, Joseph.
L590012 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I never heard that song. But what did they do?
L590011 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ "The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
L590010 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ But still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets.
L590009 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I come from Lisbon.
L590008 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
L590007 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Burke them?
L590006 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
L590005 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
L590004 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You and I should work together.
L590000 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
L589999 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
L589993 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
L589992 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
L589991 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
L589990 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Only Brother.
L589989 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Can anyone hear what we say?
L589988 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ Now that is very interesting --  Take a chair, Joseph,
L589987 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ Yes.
L589986 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
L589925 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I know --
L589924 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ What did you hear?
L589923 +++$+++ u3181 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ JOSEPH +++$+++ I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
L589922 +++$+++ u3180 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ GRAY +++$+++ I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
L589946 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
L589945 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ She would if she could.
L589944 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
L589943 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
L589723 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I'm not heartless, Ma'am.  I have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to every operation brought to me, I'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, Ma'am -- a great responsibility.
L589722 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ There's nothing I can say for one small child?
L589721 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
L589720 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
L589719 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
L589715 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
L589714 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ But can anything be done for her?
L589710 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ Three years.
L589709 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ How long ago?
L589708 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
L589707 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
L589688 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
L589687 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
L589686 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Is her pain sporadic or constant?
L589685 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ Yes, Doctor.
L589684 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Any attacks of pain since?
L589683 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ Nearly a year.
L589682 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ How long after that was the paralysis complete?
L589681 +++$+++ u3185 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MRS. MARSH +++$+++ No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
L589680 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Was the paralysis immediate?
L590116 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Aye.
L590115 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ You've been with Gray again.
L590056 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ He must leave me alone.
L590055 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ You're not going to Gray.
L590046 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ I'll get him.
L590045 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Fettes -- where is Fettes?
L590032 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You can get out.
L590031 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ Crony indeed!
L589851 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ No great lady will ever take my place?
L589850 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
L589849 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
L589848 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
L589737 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?
L589736 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ Aye --
L589735 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
L589734 +++$+++ u3183 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MEG +++$+++ Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
L589733 +++$+++ u3182 +++$+++ m209 +++$+++ MACFARLANE +++$+++ And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
L636926 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Ah. How did they treat you?
L636925 +++$+++ u3401 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ABRAMS +++$+++ Yes.
L636924 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
L636923 +++$+++ u3401 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ABRAMS +++$+++ I'm fine.
L636922 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
L636921 +++$+++ u3401 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ABRAMS +++$+++ Abrams...
L636920 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Mr. Abraham...
L637199 +++$+++ u3422 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ YOUNG LAWYER +++$+++ As far as we know, nothing.
L637198 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
L637197 +++$+++ u3422 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ YOUNG LAWYER +++$+++ Very good.
L637196 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ How good's your intelligence?
L637195 +++$+++ u3422 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ YOUNG LAWYER +++$+++ Nothing.
L637194 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ What did he find?
L637193 +++$+++ u3422 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ YOUNG LAWYER +++$+++ She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
L637192 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
L636719 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Yes.
L636718 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
L636717 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
L636716 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
L636715 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
L636714 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
L636713 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
L636712 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
L636711 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
L636710 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ No -- we don't want this case in court.
L636709 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
L636708 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ ...tell me about this case.
L636707 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ The man's an ambulance chaser...
L636706 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Four cases in three years...
L636705 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
L636704 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ He was accused of jury tampering.
L636814 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
L636813 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ What is the truth?
L636812 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ And no one will know the truth.
L636811 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
L636810 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes. It would be.
L636809 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ That was our insurance company's recommendation.
L636808 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
L636807 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Yes.
L636806 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You thought it was just.
L636805 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ We thought it was just.
L636804 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ How did you settle on the amount?
L636803 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
L636740 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
L636739 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
L636738 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What does it mean?
L636737 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That's the call that I'm waiting for.
L636734 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
L636733 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ This is going to drive the ante up.
L636732 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
L636731 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
L636730 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You know what that would mean?
L636729 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It looks that way.
L636728 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...he wants to testify...?
L636727 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital.'
L636726 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Gruber...
L636725 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
L636724 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...yes. Get her on the phone...
L636723 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
L636722 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mickey told me to come back to work.
L636721 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L637501 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
L637500 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ And why, please tell us, would you think that?
L637499 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I thought I would need it.
L637498 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
L637494 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
L637493 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
L637492 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
L637491 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You've just said you signed it.
L637490 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ That's not my handwriting.
L637489 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
L637488 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I do. Yes.
L637487 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ 'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
L637486 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ They lied.
L637483 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You know these doctors could have settled out of court. They wanted a trial. They wanted to clear their names.
L637482 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I...
L637481 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
L637480 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I... yes.
L637479 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
L637478 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I...
L637477 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
L637476 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L637475 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
L637474 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L637473 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Just now...
L637472 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L637471 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
L637470 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ No.
L637469 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You would not...?
L637468 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I wouldn't do it.
L637467 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
L637466 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ It's a crime.
L637465 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
L637232 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Objection.
L637231 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I did.
L637228 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
L637227 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
L637226 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
L637225 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
L637224 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I'm on the staff of...
L637223 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
L637222 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I am seventy-four years old.
L637221 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ How old are you?
L637220 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ 'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
L637219 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...of Anesthesiology?
L637218 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Meth... Methodology and Technique...
L637217 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ What book is that?
L637216 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Through, through his book.
L637215 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ How is that?
L637214 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I know of him.
L637213 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
L637212 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I'm just an M.D.
L637211 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Orthopedics?
L637210 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ No.
L637209 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Neurology?
L637208 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ No.
L637207 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
L637206 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
L637205 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
L637204 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Just as you are, Sir...
L637203 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
L637202 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
L637201 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
L637485 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
L637484 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Objection!
L637292 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Your Honor...! Your Honor...
L637291 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
L637290 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
L637289 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...to get her heartbeat back...?
L637288 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Objection, we've...
L636901 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Frank Galvin. We've met before.
L636900 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Ed Concannon.
L637512 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I'm going to uphold that.
L637511 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
L637510 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
L637509 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ ...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
L637508 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
L637503 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ You may step down.
L637502 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ No further questions.
L637496 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
L637495 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
L637437 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
L637436 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Nothing further, your Honor.
L637435 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Mr. Concannon...?
L636911 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only.  When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
L636910 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Huh!
L636909 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
L637077 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Tell us.
L637076 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
L637075 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
L637074 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes!
L637073 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
L637072 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ ...We did everything we could...
L637071 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
L637070 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637069 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
L637068 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Well, we...
L637067 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ And what did your team do...
L637066 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ That's right.
L637065 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
L637063 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
L637062 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
L637061 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Tell me one?
L637060 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Well, many reasons, actually...
L637059 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
L637058 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
L637057 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ 'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
L637056 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ We went to Code Blue...
L637055 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ What did these people do when her heart stopped?
L637054 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
L637053 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...
L637052 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
L637051 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Thank you. When Debby...
L637049 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ When she...
L637048 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Anything special about the case?
L637047 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637046 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
L637045 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637044 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
L637043 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ ...I was one of a group of...
L637042 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
L637041 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ I was her doctor.
L637040 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Say it.
L637039 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637038 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
L637037 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
L637036 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
L636960 +++$+++ u3406 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
L636959 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
L636958 +++$+++ u3406 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
L636957 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
L636956 +++$+++ u3406 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
L636955 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
L636954 +++$+++ u3406 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
L636953 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ It's all right, Mickey.
L636952 +++$+++ u3406 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did?
L636951 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Hold on a second.
L636950 +++$+++ u3406 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
L636700 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement...
L636699 +++$+++ u3406 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ What is this going to cost?
L636696 +++$+++ u3406 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ We just...
L636695 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I completely understand...
L636694 +++$+++ u3406 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ ...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
L636693 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
L636692 +++$+++ u3406 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ ...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
L636689 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
L636688 +++$+++ u3406 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ ...that's all right.
L636687 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
L637305 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ No. No. Thank you. You go home.
L637304 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ You sure you don't want me to stay on.
L637303 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes... I... yes.
L637302 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
L637301 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
L637300 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
L637299 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ No, you did fine.
L637298 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I didn't do too well for you.
L637240 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
L637239 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
L637238 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
L637237 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
L637236 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
L637091 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ There's nothing they can do to me.
L637090 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
L637089 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ ...What difference would...
L637088 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
L637087 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ ...I made a reservation at...
L637086 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
L637085 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
L637084 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
L637083 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ That's what I'd planned to...
L637082 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
L637080 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ It was good of you to meet...
L637079 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Dr. Thompson...?
L637251 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I... um...
L637250 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ The Doctors were not negligent.
L637249 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
L637248 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
L637247 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
L637242 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Well...
L637241 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
L637144 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ It's a common medical term.
L637143 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ 'Code Blue'...
L637142 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
L637141 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
L637140 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ She getting good care over there?
L637139 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ ...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
L637138 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
L637137 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I am on the staff of...
L637136 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
L637135 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I am seventy-four years old.
L637134 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
L637133 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ ...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
L637132 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
L637131 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
L637130 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Why is that?
L637129 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
L637434 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Thank you.
L637433 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
L637432 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
L637431 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
L637430 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
L637429 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637428 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ And you wrote that...
L637427 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ I. Yes. It is.
L637426 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ 'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
L637425 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes. I wrote it.
L637424 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
L636777 +++$+++ u3410 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
L636776 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Uh, why, why are you doing this?
L636775 +++$+++ u3410 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ ...that's perfectly all right.
L636774 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Thank you...
L636772 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony...
L636771 +++$+++ u3410 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ I understand.
L636770 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
L636767 +++$+++ u3410 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...?  Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge...
L636766 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of...
L636764 +++$+++ u3410 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
L636763 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ The most respected...
L636762 +++$+++ u3410 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
L636761 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Do you know who her doctors were?
L636760 +++$+++ u3410 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
L636759 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm sorry...?
L636758 +++$+++ u3410 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ Her doctors killed her.
L636757 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors...
L636756 +++$+++ u3410 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ Why?
L636755 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes.
L636754 +++$+++ u3410 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ You're going to settle out of court?
L636753 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes.
L636752 +++$+++ u3410 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ ...and you're going to do that?
L636751 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
L636750 +++$+++ u3410 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ Right. Who called?
L636749 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
L636748 +++$+++ u3410 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ ...Deborah Ann Kaye...
L636747 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...Deborah Ann Kaye...
L636746 +++$+++ u3410 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ I read the hospital report on your client.
L636745 +++$+++ u3410 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
L636744 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
L636743 +++$+++ u3410 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ Yes? Galvin, right?
L636742 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Dr. Gruber...
L637463 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L637462 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ A single hour.
L637461 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I did.
L637460 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
L637459 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L637458 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ One hour.
L637457 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
L637456 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What did she say?
L637455 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L637454 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
L637453 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
L637452 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
L637451 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L637449 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L637448 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
L637447 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes...
L637446 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Kathy Price...
L637409 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
L637408 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I used to be a nurse.
L637407 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes.
L637406 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Mrs. Simmonds.
L637405 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Mrs...
L637404 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Who told you that?
L637403 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
L637402 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Thank you.
L637401 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Four. You're great with these kids.
L637400 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ How old is he?
L637399 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
L637398 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You live in the neighborhood?
L637397 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I've been meaning to come in a long time.
L637396 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Hi. How are you doing?
L637395 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Hi.
L637516 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Noted. Thank you.  Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed...
L637515 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Exception!
L637514 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Overruled...
L637513 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I object, your Honor...
L637506 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Mr. Concannon...?
L637505 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Nothing further, your Honor...
L637263 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
L637262 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
L637261 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Are you done?
L637260 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
L637259 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Galvin, look, many years ago...
L637258 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
L637257 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Listen to me, fella...
L637256 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
L637255 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
L637246 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin. Let's not waste these people's time. Answer the question, Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
L637245 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
L637244 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Galvin?
L637235 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I believe that's the law... is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
L637234 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What?
L637233 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
L637230 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
L637229 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
L637188 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Defense...?
L637187 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Ready, your Honor.
L637186 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Is the Plaintiff ready?
L636999 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
L636998 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I could subpoena him if I had a week.
L636997 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ That happens.
L636996 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I had a witness disappear on me.
L636995 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
L636994 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I need an extension for my case.
L636993 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ That's perfectly all right.
L636992 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Thank you for seeing me.
L636991 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ What is it?
L636918 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm sure you would.
L636917 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief.
L636916 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
L636915 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ ...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
L636914 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...things change.
L636913 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
L636908 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you.
L636907 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ My client can't walk, your Honor.
L636906 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
L636905 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ This is a complicated case, your Honor...
L636904 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
L636899 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I was held up.
L636898 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Why is that?
L636897 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yessir. I'm sorry.
L637355 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Call the A.M.A.  ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody... you have to find this nurse...
L637354 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I have to talk to you.
L637353 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Thank you.
L637310 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I don't have a goddamned idea.
L637309 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L637308 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ No.
L637307 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Is it over?
L637177 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yes.  We've all got to let go.
L637176 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ No... no...
L637175 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You're pressuring yourself...
L637174 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Stop pressuring me...
L637173 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Joe...  Joe...
L637171 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.
L637170 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What is that to you...?
L637169 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
L637168 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ It's over!
L637167 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
L637166 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You, you don't under...
L637165 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
L637164 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ If I don't 'grow up...'
L637163 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Not if you don't grow up...
L637162 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Is there going to be a later...?
L637161 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Maybe I'll tell you later.
L637160 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ And what makes you so tough?
L637159 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
L637158 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Who told you that?
L637157 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
L637156 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I...
L637155 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
L637154 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I... do you want me to leave?
L637153 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Well, then what are you doing here?
L637152 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes.
L637151 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ And it's over...?
L637150 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That's what I am.
L637149 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You're talking like a drunk.
L637148 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
L637147 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Isn't there something you...
L637146 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Do you think it's my fault?
L637031 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yes.
L637030 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You're going to stay here...?
L637029 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
L637028 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I've got to work.
L637027 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Why don't you get some rest?
L637026 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ No, no, I'm just...
L637025 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Do you want me to go...?
L637024 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I've got to work...
L637023 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ ...and is that serious?
L637022 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They, uh, they got to my witness.
L637021 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What happened...?
L637020 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
L637019 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Is this a bad time.
L637018 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What...?
L637017 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?
L636894 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That's what I'm going to try to do.
L636893 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
L636892 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Maybe I can do something right.
L636891 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Maybe what?
L636890 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
L636889 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ And are they going to get it?
L636888 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
L636887 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I think I will.
L636886 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
L636884 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You just got lucky.  D'you eat yet? Come on.
L636883 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
L636882 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
L636881 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Laura.
L636880 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
L636879 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Who says I'm the one that called it off?
L636878 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
L636877 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yes. It was, actually.
L636876 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Really. How wonderful for you.
L636875 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ My ex-husband was a lawyer.
L636874 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm a lawyer.
L636873 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ And what are you? A cop?
L636872 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What Hotel are you staying at?
L636871 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ The TV didn't work.
L636870 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Why?
L636869 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I changed my room at the Hotel.
L636868 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I changed my life today. What did you do?
L636867 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Still looking.
L636866 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ D'you find an apartment?
L637386 +++$+++ u3421 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work.
L637385 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
L637384 +++$+++ u3421 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.

L637095 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Let me talk to Mickey.
L637094 +++$+++ u3421 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Mr. Galvin's...
L637007 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
L637006 +++$+++ u3421 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I can't guarantee that...
L637005 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
L637004 +++$+++ u3421 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
L637003 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
L637002 +++$+++ u3421 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
L637001 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Mr. Alito, please.
L637000 +++$+++ u3421 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Continental Casualty...
L637122 +++$+++ u3416 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
L637121 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
L637120 +++$+++ u3416 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ You know, you're pushy, fella...
L637119 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Then why don't you testify?
L637118 +++$+++ u3416 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
L637117 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
L637116 +++$+++ u3416 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
L637115 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Who are you protecting, then?
L637114 +++$+++ u3416 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ I didn't do it, Mister.
L637113 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Who put my client in the hospital for life.
L637112 +++$+++ u3416 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ And ask me what?
L637111 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
L637110 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
L637109 +++$+++ u3416 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ Nothing happened.
L637108 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You know what happened.
L637107 +++$+++ u3416 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ I've got nothing to say to you.
L637106 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
L637105 +++$+++ u3416 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ ...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
L637104 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
L637103 +++$+++ u3416 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ No.
L637102 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
L637101 +++$+++ u3416 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
L637100 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
L637267 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes.
L637266 +++$+++ u3419 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
L637265 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
L637264 +++$+++ u3419 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ What does it mean?  I... I mean we, you have other tactics...
L636698 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to see you get that chance.
L636697 +++$+++ u3419 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.
L636691 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
L636690 +++$+++ u3419 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ He saw her at the Northern Care...
L636685 +++$+++ u3419 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ ...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
L636684 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...I understand...
L636683 +++$+++ u3419 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
L636682 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...I understand...
L636681 +++$+++ u3419 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
L636680 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...fifty thousand dollars?
L636679 +++$+++ u3419 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
L636678 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes. Yes, I have.
L636677 +++$+++ u3419 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ ...You saw her?
L636676 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...I know. I went...
L636675 +++$+++ u3419 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
L636674 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...I'm sure you do...
L636673 +++$+++ u3419 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ ...we, we love her, Dick and me...
L636672 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
L636671 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
L636669 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ It's locked?
L636668 +++$+++ u3419 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It's locked.
L636667 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
L636978 +++$+++ u3415 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.  He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
L636977 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
L636976 +++$+++ u3415 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
L636975 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
L636974 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Where is he?
L636973 +++$+++ u3415 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ He's not in, Sir.
L636972 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
L636971 +++$+++ u3415 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ Dr. Gruber's not in.
L636970 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Dr. Gruber.
L636790 +++$+++ u3411 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ That's for sure, Frank.
L636789 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ It's a long road that has no turning.
L636788 +++$+++ u3411 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yeah.
L636787 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Well, well, well. Huh?
L636779 +++$+++ u3411 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Thanks, Franky.
L636778 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I want to buy you a drink.
L636653 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
L636652 +++$+++ u3411 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Another, Frank...?
L637421 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I don't want a mistrial.
L637420 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
L637419 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I don't know.
L637418 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
L637416 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
L637415 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What are you doing in New York...?
L637414 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ We got to talk.
L637413 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What the hell are you doing here?
L637365 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette...
L637364 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
L637363 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...four years ago...
L637357 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying...
L637356 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...yeah... good...
L637351 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ The Hospital...?
L637350 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ The broad has disappeared...
L637349 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
L637336 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ How old are you, how many children... when did you last eat...
L637335 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ The 'History'...?
L637334 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
L637333 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What did she do?
L637332 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Uh... the admitting nurse...
L637331 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What difference can that make...? All right...
L637330 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
L637329 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
L637328 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...one of the other nurses?
L637327 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ 'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
L637326 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Read me what she said.
L637325 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
L637324 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ The Doctors.
L637323 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
L637322 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yeah. I'm awake.
L637321 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Are you with me... are you awake...?
L637314 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I think we tried that. The case is over.
L637313 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That's right.
L637312 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You use their witness.
L637311 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
L637182 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yeah.
L637181 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ And all we've got is a witch doctor!
L637180 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm swell.
L637179 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ How are you holding up?
L637099 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
L637098 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
L637097 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ D'you find the obstetric nurse?
L637096 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yeah? How's our new witness?
L637014 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
L637013 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I can't talk now.
L637012 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What happened, Joey...?
L636941 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
L636940 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
L636939 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
L636938 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Today is Tuesday. What?
L636937 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Oh shit, what's today?
L636936 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
L636935 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
L636934 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
L636933 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They still have to take it to a jury.
L636932 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
L636931 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ So what?
L636930 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
L636929 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
L636928 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Been a long time, huh...?
L636864 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to get laid.
L636863 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
L636862 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
L636861 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
L636860 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You got a good memory, Franky.
L636859 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
L636858 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Right.
L636857 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
L636856 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Right.
L636855 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ 'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
L636854 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ No.
L636853 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
L636852 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...Gruber's not bad.
L636851 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
L636850 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
L636849 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Admittance form is wrong.
L636848 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
L636847 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
L636846 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Who have we got?
L636836 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help.  Mick, will you help me...?  Will you help me...?
L636835 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
L636834 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...I have to stand up for her...
L636833 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
L636832 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...he's a good man...
L636831 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
L636830 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
L636829 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What?

L636827 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it. We let them buy the case. That's what I took it for. You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
L636826 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
L636825 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
L636824 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to help her.
L636823 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
L636822 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...I'm going to need your help...
L636821 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Are you out of your mind...?
L636820 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Don't touch anything.
L636819 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Come on. Let's get a drink.
L636818 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What do you want?
L636817 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I have to talk to you.
L636664 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
L636663 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...hey, I don't need your charity...
L636662 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
L636661 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
L636660 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
L636659 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...now who is that...?
L636658 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
L636657 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Uh...
L636656 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
L636655 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Hi, Mickey...
L637347 +++$+++ u3418 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ROONEY +++$+++ You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
L637346 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What?
L637345 +++$+++ u3418 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ROONEY +++$+++ In New York?
L637344 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I just saw her.
L637343 +++$+++ u3418 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ROONEY +++$+++ She did?
L637342 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ She told me.
L637341 +++$+++ u3418 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ROONEY +++$+++ I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
L637340 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
L637297 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
L637296 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Huh. And why is that?
L637295 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637294 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
L637293 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
L637287 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
L637286 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
L637285 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What happened in those three minutes...?
L637284 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ ...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
L637283 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What happened in those three...
L637282 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
L637281 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...they start again three minutes earlier...
L637280 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ As I've said we had some more...
L637279 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
L637278 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ We, we were rather busy...
L637277 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
L637276 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Yes, the roving nurse...
L637275 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...of the procedures...
L637274 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637273 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...there are notations every thirty seconds...
L637272 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Yes, that's correct.
L637271 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
L637270 +++$+++ u3420 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637269 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Dr. Towler...
L636989 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.  P.S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years.  You like that story?
L636988 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Me, too.
L636987 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
L636986 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Huh.
L636985 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
L636984 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ The Big Boy did...?
L636983 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
L636982 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yes.
L636981 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
L636980 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Should I?
L636979 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
L636963 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ So far you're great. You got a cigarette?
L636962 +++$+++ u3414 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ How'm I doing so far?
L636961 +++$+++ u3417 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
L46518 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
L46517 +++$+++ u3726 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BLONDE +++$+++ So this is your mother's apartment?
L46515 +++$+++ u3726 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BLONDE +++$+++ Under the mat? 
L46514 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Not there.  Under the mat.
L46512 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.
L46511 +++$+++ u3726 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BLONDE +++$+++ I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
L46510 +++$+++ u3726 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BLONDE +++$+++ You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
L46504 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Yeah.  How much?
L46503 +++$+++ u3726 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BLONDE +++$+++ This the place?
L46495 +++$+++ u3726 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BLONDE +++$+++ That's sweet.  That's real sweet.
L46494 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ My mother.
L46493 +++$+++ u3726 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BLONDE +++$+++ I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?
L47206 +++$+++ u3736 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. DREYFUSS +++$+++ You wash 'em, you break 'em. I'll come back for them later.  If he makes trouble, give me a yell.
L47205 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
L47204 +++$+++ u3736 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. DREYFUSS +++$+++ What did I tell you?
L47203 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
L47202 +++$+++ u3736 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. DREYFUSS +++$+++ You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
L47200 +++$+++ u3736 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. DREYFUSS +++$+++ So what are you waiting for -- a singing commercial?
L47199 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
L47198 +++$+++ u3736 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
L47197 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, I have some paper towels --
L47196 +++$+++ u3736 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. DREYFUSS +++$+++ You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
L47158 +++$+++ u3736 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
L47157 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
L47156 +++$+++ u3736 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. DREYFUSS +++$+++ From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
L47155 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Ma'am?
L47154 +++$+++ u3736 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
L47153 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
L46449 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
L46448 +++$+++ u3736 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
L46447 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I seem to have dropped my key.  Oh -- here it is.
L46446 +++$+++ u3736 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Something the matter?
L46445 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
L46598 +++$+++ u3735 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MOFFETT +++$+++ It's a bet.
L46597 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Shall we say -- a dollar?
L46596 +++$+++ u3735 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MOFFETT +++$+++ I've been here twice as long as you have --
L46595 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Care to make a small wager?
L46594 +++$+++ u3735 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MOFFETT +++$+++ What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
L46593 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh!
L46592 +++$+++ u3735 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MOFFETT +++$+++ She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
L46591 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sheldrake?
L46590 +++$+++ u3735 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MOFFETT +++$+++ All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
L47607 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Shut up and deal!
L47606 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
L47605 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Seven --  -- queen.
L47604 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I love you, Miss Kubelik.
L47602 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.
L47601 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What about Mr. Sheldrake?
L47600 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ In there.
L47599 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
L47598 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
L47596 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Of course not.
L47595 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Mind if I come in?
L47594 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm fine all over.
L47593 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Are you sure? How's your knee?
L47592 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm fine.
L47591 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Are you all right?
L47520 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Good night, Miss Kubelik.
L47519 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Good night, Mr. Baxter.
L47518 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That's very wise.
L47517 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
L47516 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
L47515 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Oh.
L47514 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --
L47513 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Yes.  You walking to the subway?
L47512 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
L47511 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I guess so.
L47510 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
L47509 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I never thought he'd do it.
L47508 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
L47507 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
L47506 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
L47505 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ How's everything at the apartment?
L47504 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Fine.
L47503 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Fine. How's your eye?
L47502 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
L47431 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ So I want you to keep a clear head.
L47430 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Oh.
L47429 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ We're going to finish that gin game.
L47428 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I don't?
L47427 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You don't have to if you don't want to --
L47426 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ What?
L47425 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I mean, after that?
L47424 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ The dishes?
L47423 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You know what we're going to do after dinner?
L47422 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Cheers.
L47421 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
L47420 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ You usually eat alone?
L47419 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
L47418 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Might as well go all the way.
L47417 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I see you bought some napkins.
L47416 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
L47415 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Shall I light the candles?
L47414 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
L47413 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
L47412 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No -- just come as you are.
L47411 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Are we dressing for dinner?
L47385 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Yes, nurse.
L47384 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
L47383 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
L47382 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Of course not. Here's the fruit cake.  And you want to see my knee? 
L47381 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
L47380 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
L47379 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ That's terrible.
L47378 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
L47377 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ In the knee?
L47376 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Here.
L47375 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Where?
L47374 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
L47373 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ No, I don't.
L47372 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
L47371 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Over a girl?
L47370 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
L47369 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ You did?
L47368 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
L47367 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
L47366 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
L47365 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I really ought to be getting home. My family will be flipping by now.
L47364 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
L47363 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
L47362 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ A what?
L47361 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I know so. He's a taker.
L47360 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I guess so.
L47359 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
L47358 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
L47357 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
L47356 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
L47355 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
L47353 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, things are a little disorganized around here.
L47352 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
L47351 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Thank you.
L47350 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
L47349 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What are you doing with that?
L47348 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Oh.
L47347 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ In this house, you're supposed to.
L47346 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Are you supposed to?
L47345 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
L47344 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
L47343 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
L47342 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Sure.  What's that funny smell?
L47341 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Are you all right?
L47326 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I think you should. I have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that's left around here is one frozen pizza --  I'll be right back -- okay?
L47325 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I don't want to talk to him.
L47324 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ -- Mr. Sheldrake.
L47323 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ For me?
L47322 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ There's a call for you --
L47300 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.
L47299 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
L47298 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I would.
L47297 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Who'd care?
L47296 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
L47295 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
L47294 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
L47293 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I just want some fresh air.
L47292 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
L47291 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Would you mind opening the window?
L47290 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
L47289 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Who was that?
L47262 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Gin.
L47261 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Sure.
L47260 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You sure you want to throw that card?
L47259 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You bet. I got a terrific hand.
L47258 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Do I have to?
L47257 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Pick up your cards and let's go.
L47256 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I don't like myself very much anyway.
L47255 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
L47254 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Why not?
L47253 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
L47252 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
L47251 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You are?
L47250 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
L47249 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What for?
L47248 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Can I have that pad and the pencil?
L47247 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No doubt about it.
L47246 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ You really think so?
L47245 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm sure that's the explanation.
L47244 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
L47243 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
L47242 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Was he really upset when you told him?
L47241 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
L47240 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
L47239 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Too slow?
L47238 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
L47237 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Cut.
L47236 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
L47235 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
L47233 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Gin.
L47232 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
L47231 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ A cemetery?
L47230 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
L47229 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ A bad insurance risk?
L47228 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
L47227 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Pick a card.
L47226 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I don't want it.
L47225 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
L47224 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Why do people have to love people, anyway?
L47223 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Give what up?
L47222 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I think I'm going to give it all up.
L47219 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ You don't have to entertain me.
L47218 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I am. Let me get the cards.
L47217 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I'm not very good at it.
L47216 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?
L47214 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sure.
L47213 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
L47212 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
L47211 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Open it.
L47210 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
L47209 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
L47208 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
L47207 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ She doesn't seem to like you very much.
L47188 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
L47187 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
L47186 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ He doesn't give a damn about me.
L47185 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
L47184 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Thanks for reminding me.
L47183 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
L47182 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
L47181 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Miss Kubelik, I don't think you ought to call anybody -- not till that chewing gum is out of your head. 
L47180 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ They had to pump it out.
L47179 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Your stomach?
L47178 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ No -- it's my stomach.
L47177 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Something wrong with your legs?
L47176 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ As soon as I can walk.
L47175 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ When are you coming home?
L47174 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Miss. 
L47173 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What's her first name?
L47172 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Baxter.
L47171 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What's your friend's name?
L47170 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I mean -- her apartment.
L47169 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ His apartment?
L47168 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ In his apartment.
L47167 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ And where are you now?
L47166 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Someone from the office.
L47165 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Who?
L47164 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
L47163 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
L47162 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
L47161 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
L47160 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
L47159 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
L47151 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'll fix you some coffee.
L47150 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ No -- I don't want anything.
L47149 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Here. How about some breakfast?
L47147 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
L47146 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I just want to go brush my teeth --
L47145 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
L47144 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sure I do. It's always nice to have company for Christmas.
L47143 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ You don't want me here --
L47142 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
L47141 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Where's my dress? I have to go home.
L47140 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Two o'clock.
L47139 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
L47138 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
L47137 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
L47136 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Let me help you.
L47135 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
L47134 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
L47133 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
L47071 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
L47070 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
L47069 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I don't understand --
L47068 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
L47067 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
L47066 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
L46921 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ All right. Have a nice Christmas.
L46920 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
L46919 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Your phone.
L46918 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
L46917 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ The mirror -- it's broken.
L46916 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ What is it?
L46915 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
L46914 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Here.
L46913 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You don't think it's tilted a little too much --
L46912 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I think so.
L46911 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
L46910 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
L46909 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?
L46906 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ He and I are like this.  Sent me a Christmas card. See?
L46905 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Why?
L46904 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
L46903 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
L46902 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
L46901 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ This is a bad day for me.
L46900 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
L46899 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Much better.
L46898 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
L46897 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Of course not.
L46896 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
L46895 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ No -- I like it.
L46894 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
L46891 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Why don't we step into any office? There's something I want your advice about, anyway.  I have my own office now, naturally. And you may be interested to know I'm the second youngest executive in the company -- the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.
L46890 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
L46889 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You all right? What's the matter?
L46876 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I thought so.
L46875 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Three.
L46874 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ How many of those drinks did you have?
L46873 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
L46872 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
L46871 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
L46870 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You're so right.
L46869 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
L46868 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ One more?
L46867 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Cheers.
L46866 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
L46865 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
L46864 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
L46863 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ You shouldn't.
L46862 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I forgive you.
L46861 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
L46860 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
L46859 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
L46858 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What gave you that idea?
L46857 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
L46856 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Marry Christmas.
L46734 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Eight-thirty!
L46733 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
L46732 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I know your height, your weight and your Social Security number -- you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your appendix out.
L46731 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Oh.
L46730 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
L46729 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ How come?
L46728 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
L46727 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
L46726 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
L46725 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ So I see.
L46724 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
L46723 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ How is your cold?
L46722 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
L46721 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
L46720 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
L46719 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
L46718 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Eight-thirty.
L46717 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ What time does the show go on?
L46716 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
L46715 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, I understand.
L46714 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
L46713 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
L46712 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
L46711 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
L46710 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Just tell 'em -- now and then.
L46709 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
L46708 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ No. Like a man.
L46707 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
L46706 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
L46705 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah.
L46704 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ You mean tonight?
L46703 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
L46702 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Sure.
L46701 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Would you like to?
L46700 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ No.
L46699 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
L46698 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
L46697 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
L46696 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
L46695 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Good night.
L46694 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Good night.
L46612 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Fine.  Wait.
L46611 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
L46610 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I hope everything goes all right.
L46608 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
L46607 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
L46606 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Really?
L46605 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
L46604 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
L46603 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
L46602 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
L46601 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Twenty-seven.
L46540 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I should have stayed in bed last night.
L46539 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ You should have stayed in bed this morning.
L46538 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That's me. 
L46537 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
L46536 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Why?
L46535 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ That makes me feel just terrible.
L46534 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
L46533 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Oh, I never catch colds.
L46532 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah.  I better not get too close.
L46531 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Say, you got a lulu.
L46530 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I sort of like it.
L46529 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
L46528 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What did you do to your hair?
L46525 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Morning, Miss Kubelik.
L46524 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Morning, Mr. Baxter.
L47338 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Gas?
L47337 +++$+++ u3737 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. LIEBERMAN +++$+++ I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
L47336 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What for?
L47335 +++$+++ u3737 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. LIEBERMAN +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
L47104 +++$+++ u3737 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. LIEBERMAN +++$+++ I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
L47103 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
L47102 +++$+++ u3737 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. LIEBERMAN +++$+++ What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
L47101 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
L47100 +++$+++ u3737 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. LIEBERMAN +++$+++ All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
L47099 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Last night?
L47098 +++$+++ u3737 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. LIEBERMAN +++$+++ So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
L47097 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
L46429 +++$+++ u3737 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. LIEBERMAN +++$+++ Good night, Mr. Baxter.
L46428 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
L46427 +++$+++ u3737 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. LIEBERMAN +++$+++ Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
L46426 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
L46425 +++$+++ u3737 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MRS. LIEBERMAN +++$+++ Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
L47555 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
L47554 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Now hold on, Baxter --
L47553 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
L47552 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ What's gotten into you, Baxter?
L47551 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
L47550 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ But this is the key to the executive washroom.
L47549 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No I didn't.
L47548 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
L47547 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L47546 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Now you're being bright?
L47545 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ So what's it going to be?
L47544 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I dig.
L47543 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
L47542 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No key!
L47541 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ How's that again?
L47540 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Especially not Miss Kubelik.
L47539 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
L47538 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
L47537 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ What do you mean, sorry?
L47536 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
L47535 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Now I'll have to borrow your key.
L47534 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Very clever.
L47533 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
L47532 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Don't mind what?
L47531 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
L47530 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I see.
L47529 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
L47528 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Naturally.
L47527 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
L47526 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L47525 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
L47524 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
L47500 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Oh?
L47499 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I got kicked in the head, too.
L47498 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
L47497 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L47496 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
L47495 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
L47494 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
L47493 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mine?
L47492 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You like?  It's all yours.
L47490 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
L47489 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
L47488 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Now what was your news, Baxter?
L47487 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah --
L47486 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
L47485 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You left your wife?
L47484 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
L47483 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You're going to take her off my hands?
L47482 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
L47481 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sir?
L47480 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
L47479 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
L47320 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
L47319 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
L47318 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
L47317 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
L47316 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
L47315 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
L47128 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, sir -- I understand.  She left a note -- you want me to open it and read it to you?  Well, it was just a suggestion -- no, you don't have to worry about that, Mr. Sheldrake -- I kept your name out of it so there'll be no trouble, police-wise or newspaper- wise --
L47127 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
L47126 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
L47122 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ What?
L47121 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
L47120 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
L47119 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
L47118 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
L46850 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Roger. And I'll get that other key.
L46849 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Put me down for Thursday again.
L46848 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
L46847 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
L46846 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
L46845 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
L46844 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I know how it is.
L46843 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
L46842 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sir?
L46841 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ So it was.  She threw it at me.
L46840 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
L46839 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Oh, yes. Thanks.
L46838 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
L46837 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ To me?
L46835 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.
L46834 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
L46833 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
L46832 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
L46831 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well -- I guess so.
L46830 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
L46829 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
L46825 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
L46824 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
L46823 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
L46692 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You too, sir.
L46691 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
L46690 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
L46689 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Not that I have anything to hide.
L46688 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, you don't have to worry --
L46687 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You know how people talk.
L46686 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, of course.
L46685 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
L46683 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L46682 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Relax, Baxter.
L46681 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
L46679 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
L46678 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I am?
L46677 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
L46676 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ This?
L46675 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh?  Oh!
L46674 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
L46673 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Swap them? For what?
L46672 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
L46671 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
L46670 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
L46669 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
L46668 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
L46667 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
L46666 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ How would you like to go tonight?
L46665 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
L46664 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
L46663 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L46662 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I'm not through with you yet.
L46661 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
L46660 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Where are you going, Baxter?
L46656 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
L46655 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ How do you work it with the key?
L46654 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
L46653 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Where is your apartment?
L46652 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
L46651 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
L46650 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
L46649 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
L46648 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, about six months ago -- I was going to night school, taking this course in Advanced Accounting -- and one of the guys in our department -- he lives in Jersey -- he was going to a banquet at the Biltmore -- his wife was meeting him in town, and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo -- so I gave him the key    and word must have gotten around -- because the next thing I knew, all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets -- and when you give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand -- pardon me.
L46647 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You better.
L46646 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
L46645 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Are you going to deny it?
L46644 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh.
L46643 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
L46642 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Who?
L46641 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
L46640 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sir?
L46639 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ What kind of joint are you running?
L46638 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
L46637 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ That's right, Baxter.
L46636 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ The Vice Squad?
L46635 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
L46634 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You do?
L46633 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
L46632 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Would you mind repeating the question?
L46631 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Think.
L46630 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I don't know.
L46629 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
L46628 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That's very flattering.
L46627 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
L46626 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
L46625 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
L46624 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Dobisch said that?
L46623 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
L46622 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
L46621 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
L46620 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L46619 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Baxter?
L47461 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Who else?
L47460 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ You?
L47459 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ On account of me.
L47452 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ What does he mean, accident?
L47451 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, no -- just had a little accident.
L47450 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ Fran been sick or something?
L47449 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
L47448 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
L47441 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't a lady present, I'd clobber you.
L47440 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
L47439 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
L47438 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
L47437 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
L47434 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes?
L47433 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ Baxter?
L47279 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No!
L47278 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
L47274 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Now will you get out?
L47273 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
L47272 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Are you going to leave, Mr. Kirkeby, or do I have to throw you out?
L47271 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
L47270 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
L47269 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
L47268 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You can't come in.
L47267 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ What do I -- ?  Just a minute.
L47266 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What do you want?
L47265 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Hi, Baxter.
L46828 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
L46827 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
L46811 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, I'm very grateful.
L46810 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
L46582 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
L46581 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
L46580 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
L46552 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Listen to him.  Little Lord Fauntleroy!
L46551 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
L46550 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
L46549 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
L46548 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
L46547 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
L46546 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
L46522 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, sir.  They are indeed. 
L46521 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
L46520 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
L46461 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ I'll pay you on Friday.  And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
L46460 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
L46459 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
L46458 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
L46457 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
L46456 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
L46455 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Sheldrake?
L46454 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
L46453 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
L46452 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
L46451 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
L46821 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
L46820 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You threatening me?
L46819 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
L46818 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
L46815 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
L46814 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
L46809 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I have a vague idea.
L46808 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
L46561 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
L46560 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
L46559 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
L46558 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
L46557 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
L46556 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
L46555 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
L46554 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
L46499 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
L46498 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
L46497 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
L46496 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
L46492 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.
L46491 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
L46490 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
L46489 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
L46488 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
L46487 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
L46486 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
L46485 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
L46484 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
L46483 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
L46482 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
L46807 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah.
L46806 +++$+++ u3741 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ VANDERHOF +++$+++ Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
L46574 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
L46573 +++$+++ u3741 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ VANDERHOF +++$+++ Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
L46572 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
L46571 +++$+++ u3741 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ VANDERHOF +++$+++ Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
L46570 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
L46569 +++$+++ u3741 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ VANDERHOF +++$+++ That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
L46568 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
L46567 +++$+++ u3741 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ VANDERHOF +++$+++ Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
L46566 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
L46565 +++$+++ u3741 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ VANDERHOF +++$+++ Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
L47571 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Happy New Year.
L47570 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
L47569 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
L47568 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
L47567 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
L47566 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Can you use a bottle of champagne?
L47565 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
L47564 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
L47563 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
L47562 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Where are you moving to?
L47561 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
L47560 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ What's this -- you packing?
L47559 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, I have things to do --
L47558 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
L47557 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sure, Doc.
L47556 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
L47447 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Not you -- Miss Kubelik.
L47446 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
L47445 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ How's the patient?
L47095 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
L47094 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, wasn't I?
L47093 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
L47092 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm not sure.
L47091 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
L47090 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Help yourself.
L47089 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?
L47088 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
L47087 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Aren't you?
L47086 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
L47085 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ It's regulations.
L47084 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
L47083 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ What's her address?  Where does she live?
L47082 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Kubelik -- with two k's.
L47081 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ How do you spell her last name?
L47080 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sure.
L47079 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Any of that coffee left?
L47078 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ These cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient. I ought to charge you by the mile.
L47077 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Just as long as she's okay.
L47076 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
L47064 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well -- we work in the same building -- and we try to keep it quiet --
L47063 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
L47062 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hello, Miss Kubelik.
L47045 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because you took too many sleeping pills. Do you understand what I'm saying?  Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss -- I'm here to help you. You took all those sleeping pills -- remember?
L47044 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
L47043 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ What's her name?
L47039 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.
L47038 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Something like that.
L47037 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
L47036 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
L47035 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Want to tell me what happened?
L47031 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
L47030 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What are you going to do, Doc?
L47027 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It was half-full -- about a dozen or so. You going to have to take her to the hospital?
L47026 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ How many pills were in that bottle?
L47025 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ She going to be all right, Doc?
L47008 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Let me get my bag.
L47007 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
L46477 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Slow down, kid.
L46476 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
L46475 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
L46474 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Me?
L46473 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
L46472 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
L46471 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
L46470 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
L46469 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
L46468 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
L46467 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
L46466 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
L46465 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
L46464 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
L46463 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Good evening, Baxter.
L47024 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
L47023 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
L47021 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ My shoes.
L47020 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
L47019 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Say, what's going on here, anyway?
L47017 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
L47016 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
L47015 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ The party's over.
L47014 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Good night?
L47013 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Good night.
L47012 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Not so rough, honey.
L47000 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I'm with you, lover.
L46999 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
L46998 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
L46997 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
L46996 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ No kidding.
L46995 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
L46994 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Say, this is Snugsville.
L46991 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ I don't know you at all. BUD Permit me -- C.C. Baxter -- junior executive, Arthur Murray graduate, lover.
L46990 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
L46989 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Still stuck on her, huh.
L46988 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
L46987 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You got a girl-friend?
L46986 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No.
L46985 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Can I ask you a personal question?
L46983 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Not particularly.
L46982 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
L46981 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
L46980 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Where do we go -- my place or yours?
L46943 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
L46942 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
L46941 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No.
L46940 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Family?
L46939 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No.
L46938 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ 'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
L46937 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, you can't win 'em all.
L46936 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
L46935 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
L46934 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
L46933 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Who is Mickey?
L46932 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
L46931 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That so.
L46930 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
L46929 +++$+++ u3727 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What about him?
L46928 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
L46927 +++$+++ u3732 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
L47474 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
L47473 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ That guy really must've belted him.
L47472 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
L47471 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
L47409 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
L47408 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
L47407 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
L47397 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.
L47396 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ A.W.O.L.?
L47395 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
L47394 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
L47393 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Kubelik.
L47392 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Who?
L47391 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ -- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
L47073 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
L47072 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Please -- just let me sleep.
L47061 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
L47060 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
L47059 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I don't know.
L47058 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
L47057 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ No.
L47056 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Do you know where you are, Fran?
L47055 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I took sleeping pills.
L47054 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ And what happened to you?
L47053 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Dr. Dreyfuss.
L47052 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Tell me again -- what's my name?
L47051 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Get more coffee.
L47050 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Dreyfuss.
L47049 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ Dr. Dreyfuss.
L47048 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Doctor.
L47047 +++$+++ u3729 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DR. DREYFUSS +++$+++ That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
L47046 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Sleeping pills.
L47465 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
L47464 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ Come on, Fran.
L47463 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ You fool -- you damn fool.
L47458 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ Why did you take sleeping pills?
L47457 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
L47456 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ What for?
L47436 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
L47435 +++$+++ u3733 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MATUSCHKA +++$+++ What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
L46888 +++$+++ u3734 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MISS OLSEN +++$+++ Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
L46887 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Well -- thank you.
L46885 +++$+++ u3734 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MISS OLSEN +++$+++ What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
L46884 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Will you excuse me?
L46883 +++$+++ u3734 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MISS OLSEN +++$+++ And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
L46882 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L46881 +++$+++ u3734 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MISS OLSEN +++$+++ So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
L46880 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Yes, I know.
L46879 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
L46878 +++$+++ u3734 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MISS OLSEN +++$+++ Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
L47587 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
L47586 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L47585 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
L47584 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
L47583 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ The nerve.
L47582 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
L47581 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ He wouldn't.
L47580 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
L47579 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Baxter?
L47578 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
L47577 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
L47576 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
L47575 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Atlantic City?
L47574 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
L47573 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ All set for what?
L47572 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.
L47331 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ There you go again -- you know I didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just get well -- do what the nurse tells you -- I mean Baxter -- and I'll see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran. 
L47330 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
L47329 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Are you there, Fran?
L47328 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
L47327 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
L46971 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
L46970 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
L46969 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
L46968 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ You run along -- I want to fix my face.
L46967 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Coming?
L46966 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ You'll miss your train, Jeff.
L46965 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Stop that, Fran.
L46964 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
L46963 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
L46962 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
L46959 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I have a present for you. I didn't quite know what to get you -- anyway it's a little awkward for me, shopping --  -- so here's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something.
L46958 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Yeah, we better.
L46957 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
L46955 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Merry Christmas.
L46954 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
L46953 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
L46952 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
L46951 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
L46950 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Now, Fran --
L46949 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
L46948 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
L46947 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
L46946 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
L46945 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
L46944 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
L46799 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I promise.
L46798 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
L46797 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I love you -- remember?
L46796 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I have that date -- remember?
L46792 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Fran --
L46791 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ You know I do.
L46790 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
L46789 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Are you sure that's what you want?
L46788 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
L46787 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
L46786 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ What do you think?
L46785 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Handle what?
L46784 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
L46783 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Okay. I'm sorry.
L46782 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
L46781 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ I wasn't trying.
L46780 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You're not being funny.
L46779 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
L46778 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ That's enough, Fran.
L46777 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
L46776 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You didn't really believe me, did you?
L46775 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ We didn't talk about it -- you did.
L46774 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
L46773 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ We talked about a lot of things.
L46772 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Remember what we talked about?
L46771 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
L46770 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
L46766 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.
L46765 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Important?
L46764 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
L46763 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
L46762 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
L46761 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
L46760 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I want you back, Fran.
L46759 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
L46758 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
L46757 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
L46756 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I never said goodbye, Fran.
L46755 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
L46754 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L46753 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
L46752 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
L46751 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ -- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
L46750 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ It's been hell.
L46749 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Like old times. Same booth, same song --
L46748 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I missed you, Fran.
L46747 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Six weeks. But who's counting?
L46746 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ How long has it been -- a month?
L46743 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
L46742 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You know I liked it better long.
L46741 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ That's right.
L46740 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
L46739 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
L46738 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Let me take that.
L46737 +++$+++ u3730 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ FRAN +++$+++ Still afraid somebody may see us together?
L47288 +++$+++ u3739 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
L47287 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
L47286 +++$+++ u3739 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
L47285 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ What's your mother doing this afternoon?
L47284 +++$+++ u3739 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ Go where?
L47283 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
L47282 +++$+++ u3739 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ What gives?
L47281 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
L46588 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
L46587 +++$+++ u3739 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
L46586 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
L46585 +++$+++ u3739 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
L46444 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Certainly not.  I'm a happily married man.
L46443 +++$+++ u3739 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ You mean you bring other girls up here?
L46442 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
L46441 +++$+++ u3739 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
L46440 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
L46439 +++$+++ u3739 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
L46438 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Where does she live?
L46437 +++$+++ u3739 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ I told you -- with my mother.
L46436 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Where do you live?
L46435 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Don't you ever stop talking?
L46434 +++$+++ u3739 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
L46432 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Sssssh.
L46431 +++$+++ u3739 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
L46424 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ What's the difference?  Some schnook that works in the office.
L46423 +++$+++ u3739 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
L46422 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
L46421 +++$+++ u3739 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
L46420 +++$+++ u3731 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ KIRKEBY +++$+++ Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
L47312 +++$+++ u3734 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MISS OLSEN +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
L47311 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
L47310 +++$+++ u3734 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MISS OLSEN +++$+++ You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
L47309 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
L47308 +++$+++ u3734 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MISS OLSEN +++$+++ It won't happen again.
L47307 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ But I thought you could hold your tongue.
L47306 +++$+++ u3734 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MISS OLSEN +++$+++ I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
L47305 +++$+++ u3734 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MISS OLSEN +++$+++ Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
L47304 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Lovely. You were a big help.
L47303 +++$+++ u3734 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ MISS OLSEN +++$+++ Did you have a nice Christmas?
L47113 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Oh -- oh!
L47112 +++$+++ u3740 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
L47111 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ See if they'll what?
L47110 +++$+++ u3740 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
L47109 +++$+++ u3738 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ It's a thought.
L47108 +++$+++ u3740 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
L81598 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Robert - I am.  I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
L81597 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
L81596 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I love Eve very much.
L81595 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
L81594 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
L81593 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ In a day or two, yes.
L81592 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Will you be leaving now, Robert?
L81591 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Yes, I suppose that's true.
L81590 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
L81589 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... He's gone, Chauncey.
L81025 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh, really?
L81024 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
L81023 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I would like to walk today.
L81022 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you, Robert.
L81021 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
L81020 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
L81019 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
L81018 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
L81017 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ He does, does he?
L81016 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
L81015 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... Oh? You've heard?
L81014 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
L81013 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
L81012 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Robert.
L81011 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... Were you going somewhere?
L81008 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hardly any, Robert.
L81007 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
L81006 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
L81005 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
L81004 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that.  Please, sit in the chair.
L81003 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ It's fine today, Robert.
L81002 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
L80955 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Robert. I will.
L80954 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... And please call me Robert.
L80895 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I will.
L80894 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
L80893 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No.
L80892 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
L80891 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
L80890 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
L80889 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you.
L80888 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
L80887 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
L80886 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
L80885 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L80884 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ An attorney?
L80883 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
L80882 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Thomas? Who's Thomas?
L80881 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
L80880 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
L80879 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... Straight out?
L80878 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
L80877 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh, fine.
L80876 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ You can pull your trousers up, now.
L80875 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see.
L80874 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
L80873 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I think so, too.
L80872 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
L80871 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ But not for long...
L80870 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ You were wrong, it did hurt.
L80869 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
L80868 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I understand. I've seen it done before.
L80867 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
L81573 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
L81572 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
L81571 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ No more, Robert... No more needles...
L81315 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
L81314 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
L80982 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
L80981 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
L80972 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
L80971 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
L80938 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Of course! By kid-lawyers!
L80937 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
L80936 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
L81621 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
L81620 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
L81619 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
L81618 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
L81617 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I wish he were here...
L81616 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I don't think so, he should be along soon...
L81615 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Do you think we should look for him?
L81610 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
L81609 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... He walked off...
L81165 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...
L81164 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... But he's...?
L81163 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
L80906 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ No, Eve... I'm sorry.
L80905 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
L80904 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
L80903 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
L80902 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
L80901 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
L80900 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
L80899 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Stay here? Is that necessary?
L80898 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
L80897 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
L80896 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
L81478 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Certainly, glad to be of help.
L81477 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
L81476 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Of course, Doctor, I understand.
L81475 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
L81474 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
L81473 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
L81472 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
L81471 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I have no idea...
L81470 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
L81553 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
L81552 +++$+++ u3991 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BALDWIN +++$+++ Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
L81551 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
L81550 +++$+++ u3991 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BALDWIN +++$+++ I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
L81547 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
L81546 +++$+++ u3991 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BALDWIN +++$+++ Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
L81545 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
L80929 +++$+++ u3992 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
L80928 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
L80922 +++$+++ u3992 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
L80921 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ A Black man gave me the message.
L80920 +++$+++ u3992 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L80919 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh. I have a message for him.
L80918 +++$+++ u3992 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ No sir, I don't believe I do.
L80917 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Do you know Raphael?
L81201 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. I like this attic very much.
L81200 +++$+++ u4009 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ MRS. AUBREY +++$+++ Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
L81199 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I would like to be on that show.
L81198 +++$+++ u4009 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ MRS. AUBREY +++$+++ Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
L81197 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I have seen that show on television.
L81196 +++$+++ u4009 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ MRS. AUBREY +++$+++ Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
L81195 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L81194 +++$+++ u4009 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ MRS. AUBREY +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
L81169 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L81168 +++$+++ u4009 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ MRS. AUBREY +++$+++ Would you care to take it, sir?
L81167 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you.
L81166 +++$+++ u4009 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ MRS. AUBREY +++$+++ Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
L81628 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
L81627 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
L81625 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Eve.
L81624 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey! Chauncey!
L81577 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ That's very interesting, Eve.
L81576 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
L81567 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... But I've never done...  ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
L81566 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. It's very good, Eve.
L81565 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
L81564 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I like to watch.
L81563 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ To watch...? To watch me...?
L81562 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I like to watch.
L81561 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
L81557 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you.
L81556 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
L81555 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
L81554 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey...  ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...
L81542 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here -- I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort.
L81541 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
L81540 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
L81539 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
L81538 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
L81387 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Dennis.
L81386 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
L81385 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L81381 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you, Eve.
L81380 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
L81359 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until...
L81358 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. That could be true.
L81357 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
L81356 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
L81355 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
L81354 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Eve. I know that.
L81353 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
L81352 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Eve. I like you to be here.
L81351 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
L81350 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I like the President. He is a very nice man.
L81349 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
L81348 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
L81347 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
L81328 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Good night, Eve.
L81327 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Good night, Chauncey.
L81326 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...
L81325 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see.
L81324 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
L81323 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, thank you.
L81322 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
L81219 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I know you do - you and your television...  ... Good luck, Chauncey.
L81218 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ That's good. I like to watch, too.
L81217 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
L81216 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ How is Ben feeling?
L81215 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
L81214 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you, Eve.
L81213 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
L81212 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Eve.
L81211 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey...
L81171 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
L81170 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
L81162 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ So am I, Eve.
L81161 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
L81156 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Yes, so do we.
L81155 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh, I like that very much.
L81154 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Our greenhouse.
L81153 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ What is that?
L81152 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Of course.
L81151 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
L81150 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
L81149 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
L81148 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
L81147 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I was.
L81146 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
L81145 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... Mentor...?
L81144 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
L81143 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
L81142 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
L81141 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L81140 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
L81139 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.
L81138 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Fine. He's very nice.
L81137 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
L81136 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. It's feeling much better now.
L81135 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Your leg must be getting better.
L81134 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Eve.
L81133 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey!
L80998 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Good night, Eve.
L80997 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Good night, Chauncey.
L80996 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ That's good.
L80995 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Why... No, I don't think so...
L80994 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
L80993 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ He does...?
L80992 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
L80991 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Yes... I know, Chauncey.
L80990 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
L80989 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
L80988 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
L80987 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
L80961 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I am a very good gardener.
L80960 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
L80950 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. I like it here.
L80949 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
L80942 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
L80941 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
L80940 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. It won't do that.
L80939 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
L80836 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times...
L80835 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L80834 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
L80833 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I like to watch. This is fine.
L80832 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
L80831 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...
L80830 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I lost my remote control.
L80829 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Did you lose something?
L80828 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
L80827 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
L80826 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
L80825 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. I'm a gardener.
L80824 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
L80823 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ My name is Chance.
L80822 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ May I ask your name?
L80821 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Eve.
L80820 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
L80819 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh? Certainly...
L80818 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I would like to watch television.
L80817 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. Thank you.
L80816 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Would you care for a drink?
L80814 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you...  David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?
L80813 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I agree.
L80812 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
L80811 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Your family doctor?
L80810 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
L80809 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
L80808 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
L80807 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. He's a very careful driver.
L80806 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
L80805 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I am.
L80804 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I hope you're comfortable.
L80793 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
L80792 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ There's no need for a hospital.
L80791 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
L81185 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I have nothing more to say.
L81184 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
L81183 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
L81182 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
L81181 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
L81180 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
L81179 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
L81178 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
L81177 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. I'm not busy.
L81176 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
L81175 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Sid.
L81174 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
L81230 +++$+++ u4002 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HULL +++$+++ I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.
L81229 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. It's a very good show.
L81228 +++$+++ u4002 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HULL +++$+++ Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
L81227 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see.
L81226 +++$+++ u4002 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HULL +++$+++ Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
L81225 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Morton.
L81224 +++$+++ u4002 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HULL +++$+++ Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
L81525 +++$+++ u3996 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS' VOICE +++$+++ Your foot! Give me your foot!!
L81524 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see.
L81523 +++$+++ u3996 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS' VOICE +++$+++ I don't want Robert.
L81522 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
L81521 +++$+++ u3996 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS' VOICE +++$+++ Really? Really!!!
L81520 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I do, it's very good.
L81519 +++$+++ u3996 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS' VOICE +++$+++ ... Are you sure you like it?
L81518 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
L81517 +++$+++ u3996 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS' VOICE +++$+++ Do you like it?
L81516 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, very well, thank you.
L81515 +++$+++ u3996 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS' VOICE +++$+++ Can you see well?
L81453 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you.
L81452 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
L81451 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Eve. That would be good.
L81448 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!  How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!
L81447 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I like that name very much.
L81446 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
L81445 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
L81444 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Yes, it is very good!
L81443 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh, good.
L81442 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
L81441 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ So you know Krylov!
L81440 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Do you think so? Do you think so?
L81439 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
L81438 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I certainly do.
L81437 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
L81436 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
L81435 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
L81434 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I understand.
L81433 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
L81432 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I agree, I think so too.
L81431 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ ... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
L81430 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover.  Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
L81429 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Ben is very ill.
L81428 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
L81426 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
L81425 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
L81419 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling?
L81418 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I agree.
L81417 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
L81588 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... I've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... I've known success... and I've felt love... My associates, Chauncey - I've talked with them about you... They're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... I'm very fond of you, Chauncey... And I understand Eve... Tell her that... tell her I'm madly in love with her...
L81587 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I would like to do that.
L81586 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
L81585 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ A flower...
L81584 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
L81583 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh, I see.
L81582 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
L81581 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
L81580 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... Chauncey... Chauncey...
L81319 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
L81318 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
L81317 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
L81316 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Certainly, Ben.
L81131 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden.
L81130 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you, Ben.
L81129 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
L81128 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I understand.
L81127 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
L81126 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Ben.
L81125 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
L81120 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
L81119 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
L81118 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Ben - he is.
L81117 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
L81102 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. That is correct.
L81101 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
L81048 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position, Chauncey... Maybe one day...
L81047 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see, Ben.
L81046 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
L81040 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
L81039 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
L81038 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I understand.
L81037 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
L81036 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ You're looking much better today, Ben.
L81035 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Well, that's good news, my boy.
L81034 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
L81033 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
L80980 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
L80979 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
L80978 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
L80977 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Ben.
L80968 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
L80967 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
L80966 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.
L80965 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
L80964 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Bravo!
L80963 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
L80962 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.
L80959 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see. I would like to work in your garden.
L80958 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
L80953 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ And I'm Ben.
L80952 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. Chauncey is fine.
L80951 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
L80948 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
L80947 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
L80946 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
L80945 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, thank you. My house has been closed.
L80935 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... So am I, my boy - so am I.
L80934 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I am very hungry.
L80933 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
L80932 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I agree.
L80931 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
L80925 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. You look very sick.
L80924 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
L80915 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I like that very much.
L80914 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
L80913 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I feel very good in here.
L80912 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... I see.
L80911 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
L81503 +++$+++ u3995 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd.
L81502 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L81501 +++$+++ u3995 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
L81500 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I want to tell Eve.
L81499 +++$+++ u3995 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
L81498 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I like to watch very much.
L81497 +++$+++ u3995 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
L81496 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I like to watch.
L81495 +++$+++ u3995 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
L81488 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ What sort of bed is it?
L81487 +++$+++ u4016 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ STIEGLER +++$+++ Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
L81486 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I like to watch.
L81485 +++$+++ u4016 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ STIEGLER +++$+++ Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
L81484 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I can't read.
L81483 +++$+++ u4016 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ STIEGLER +++$+++ Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
L81482 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I can't write.
L81481 +++$+++ u4016 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ STIEGLER +++$+++ Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
L81480 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Ronald.
L81479 +++$+++ u4016 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ STIEGLER +++$+++ Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
L81032 +++$+++ u4014 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
L81031 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I would like to see Ben.
L81030 +++$+++ u4014 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ ... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
L81029 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L81028 +++$+++ u4014 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ ... Sir?
L81027 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
L81026 +++$+++ u4014 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
L80757 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Good day, Sally.
L80756 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ Good day, Mr. Chance.
L80737 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I have seen styles on television.
L80736 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
L80735 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
L80727 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
L80726 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
L80722 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No.
L80721 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
L80712 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ ... Oh.
L80711 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. Of men and women.
L80710 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ Some pictures...?
L80701 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I never needed money.
L80700 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ What about money?
L80693 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh. Thank you.
L80692 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
L80691 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L80690 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ ... Then you really are a gardener?
L80673 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L80672 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
L80803 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
L80802 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... My suitcase.
L80801 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Very good.
L80800 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... Yes. You can take me.
L80799 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
L80798 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I've never ridden in an automobile.
L80797 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Please, sir.
L80790 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L80789 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ It's starting to swell, is it painful?
L80788 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Of course. I would like to look.
L80787 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Let's have a look, do you mind?
L80786 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I agree.
L80785 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
L80781 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ It's very sore.
L80780 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
L80779 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
L80778 +++$+++ u4003 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
L80986 +++$+++ u4017 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ ... Yes sir - elevator!
L80985 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... Hmmm... Elevator.
L80910 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. It seems to be.
L80909 +++$+++ u4017 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
L80908 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... That is a very small room.
L80851 +++$+++ u4017 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
L80850 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ How long do we stay in here?
L80849 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see.
L80848 +++$+++ u4017 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
L80847 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Does it have a television?
L80661 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy...  ... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance...  But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours...  ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?  ... Goodbye, Chance...
L80660 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L80659 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ ... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...
L80657 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I'm going to work in the garden.
L80656 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
L80655 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I'm very hungry.
L80654 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
L80653 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. It is.
L80652 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Well, ain't that the truth...
L80651 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
L80650 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
L80649 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.
L80648 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
L80647 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I've seen that done.
L80646 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
L80645 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... I see.
L80644 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
L80643 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Good morning, Louise.
L80641 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Is his back feeling better?
L80640 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ ... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
L80639 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
L80638 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see.
L80637 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ ... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
L80636 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... Good evening, Louise.
L80635 +++$+++ u4008 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ LOUISE +++$+++ ... Evening, Chance.
L81286 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I am a very serious gardener.
L81285 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
L81284 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you.
L81283 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
L81269 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. We need a very good gardener.
L81268 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
L81254 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
L81253 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
L81252 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L81251 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
L81250 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I was there with Ben.
L81249 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
L81248 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Which view?
L81247 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
L81246 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No. I don't object.
L81245 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
L81244 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I hope so.
L81243 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ ... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
L81242 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. That is surprising.
L81241 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
L81240 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ You're welcome.
L81239 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
L81238 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L81237 +++$+++ u3997 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
L80755 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
L80754 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
L80753 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
L80752 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Correct.
L80751 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ But you won't sign, correct?
L80750 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I have no claim, Thomas.
L80749 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Come now, Mr. Chance.
L80748 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
L80747 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
L80746 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
L80745 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
L80739 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I would like to stay and work in my garden.
L80738 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
L80734 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I understand.
L80733 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
L80732 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.
L80729 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
L80728 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
L80725 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers.
L80724 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
L80723 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
L80720 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
L80719 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Have you served in the Army?
L80718 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
L80717 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
L80716 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
L80715 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
L80714 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
L80713 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
L80709 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
L80708 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ 1952...?
L80707 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
L80706 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... Joe? Who's Joe?
L80705 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
L80704 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
L80703 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, I do not have any of those.
L80702 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
L80699 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I was given meals, and a home...
L80698 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ How were you paid?
L80697 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Compensated...?
L80696 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
L80695 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No.
L80694 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
L80689 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
L80688 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Since you were a child?
L80687 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
L80686 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... How long have you been living here?
L80685 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
L80684 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
L80683 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I live here.
L80682 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
L80681 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see...
L80680 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
L80679 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
L80678 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
L80677 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
L80676 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
L80675 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Thomas - I understand.
L80674 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
L80671 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
L80670 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
L81108 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
L81107 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I will.
L81106 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
L81105 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. It has.
L81100 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
L81099 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
L81098 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... In the garden?
L81097 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
L81096 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
L81080 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
L81079 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I will.
L81078 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
L81076 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... Oh, really...
L81075 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
L81072 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... Hello.
L81071 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. President.
L81308 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ I said - try again.
L81307 +++$+++ u4007 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KINNEY +++$+++ Sid, it's useless!
L81306 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Try again.
L81305 +++$+++ u4007 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KINNEY +++$+++ Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
L81304 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ Try again.
L81303 +++$+++ u4007 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KINNEY +++$+++ ... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
L81223 +++$+++ u4007 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KINNEY +++$+++ ... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
L81222 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ ... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
L81221 +++$+++ u4007 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KINNEY +++$+++ ... Nothing.
L81220 +++$+++ u3994 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ COURTNEY +++$+++ ... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
L81321 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
L81320 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Ben, really...
L81282 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ That's good... That's good.
L81281 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Yes, I am, Ben.
L81280 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached...  ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
L80944 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Do you need a secretary?
L80943 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
L80863 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
L80862 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Do you feel well enough for that?
L80861 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
L80860 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
L80859 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
L80858 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You heard?
L80857 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
L80856 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ No headaches?
L80855 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
L80854 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
L80843 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
L80842 +++$+++ u4017 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L80841 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
L80840 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
L80839 +++$+++ u4017 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
L80838 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Good evening, Wilson.
L80837 +++$+++ u4017 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
L81424 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Would you two excuse me for a moment?
L81423 +++$+++ u4015 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
L81395 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
L81394 +++$+++ u4015 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
L81393 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
L81392 +++$+++ u4015 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ And look who you brought with!
L81391 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Hello, Sophie.
L81390 +++$+++ u4015 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
L81612 +++$+++ u3999 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
L81611 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ I can certainly understand that...
L81509 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ It's not that, I just...
L81508 +++$+++ u3999 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
L81507 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
L81506 +++$+++ u3999 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ ... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
L81505 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ No, that won't do any good.
L81504 +++$+++ u3999 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ ... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
L81403 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as...
L81402 +++$+++ u3999 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
L81401 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
L81400 +++$+++ u3999 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FIRST LADY +++$+++ Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
L81399 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... How are the kids getting along?
L80744 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Well... He's either very, very bright or very, very dense - he's hard to figure...  ... Let's just keep everything legal.
L80743 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ ... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
L80742 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... Yeah...
L80741 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
L80740 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... What do you make of all this?
L80668 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
L80667 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ ... Would you take me on a tour?
L80666 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
L80665 +++$+++ u4001 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ ... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
L81293 +++$+++ u4004 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JOHANNA +++$+++ I said good night!
L81292 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Look, Johanna...
L81291 +++$+++ u4004 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JOHANNA +++$+++ Good night.
L81290 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
L81289 +++$+++ u4004 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JOHANNA +++$+++ ... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
L81264 +++$+++ u4004 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JOHANNA +++$+++ He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
L81263 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ No! He's a real gardener!
L81262 +++$+++ u4004 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ JOHANNA +++$+++ Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
L81261 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ It's that gardener!
L81465 +++$+++ u4005 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KARPATOV +++$+++ Very good, Your Excellency.
L81464 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
L81463 +++$+++ u4005 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KARPATOV +++$+++ Clearly, yes comrade.
L81462 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
L81461 +++$+++ u4005 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KARPATOV +++$+++ Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
L81460 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
L81459 +++$+++ u4005 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KARPATOV +++$+++ There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
L81458 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
L81457 +++$+++ u4005 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KARPATOV +++$+++ Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
L81456 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
L81455 +++$+++ u4005 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KARPATOV +++$+++ We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
L81454 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Yes? What have you found?
L81409 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
L81408 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Good. Anything else?
L81407 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
L81406 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Oh? What?
L81405 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
L81345 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ I would appreciate that.
L81344 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
L81343 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... So what does all that add up to?
L81340 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L81339 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
L81338 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
L81337 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
L81336 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
L81335 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ So...? Where the hell is it?
L81334 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Right, Chief.
L81333 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
L81332 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ No, sir.
L81331 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ This is not what I requested.
L81207 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Right, Chief.
L81206 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
L81205 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
L81204 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
L81203 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
L81202 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
L81124 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ No problem, Chief.
L81123 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
L81122 +++$+++ u4006 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ KAUFMAN +++$+++ Gardiner, yes, sir.
L81121 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
L81536 +++$+++ u4010 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ NOVOGROD +++$+++ Let us toast to the success of the coup.
L81535 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Thank you, Colonel.
L81534 +++$+++ u4010 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ NOVOGROD +++$+++ You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
L81533 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
L81532 +++$+++ u4010 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ NOVOGROD +++$+++ That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
L81531 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
L81530 +++$+++ u4010 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ NOVOGROD +++$+++ But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
L81529 +++$+++ u4013 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ SKRAPINOV +++$+++ That could be possible...
L81528 +++$+++ u4010 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ NOVOGROD +++$+++ The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
L81116 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Mr. Gardiner...
L81115 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ You take care too, Bobby.
L81114 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Take care of yourself, Ben.
L81113 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
L81112 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
L81111 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
L81110 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
L81109 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
L81095 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I'm afraid so.
L81094 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ It's that serious, huh?
L81093 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
L81088 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.
L81087 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
L81086 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Well, Ben... I...
L81085 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
L81084 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ ... Well?
L81083 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Yes, I did.
L81082 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
L81074 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
L81073 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
L81070 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.
L81069 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
L81068 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
L81067 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... Mr. President, how good to see you.
L81066 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Ben!
L112739 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before I give you a big hug.  I love this guy.
L112738 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What if there is no tomorrow?
L112737 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
L112736 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No ...
L112735 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
L112440 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Pierce.  You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you.
L112439 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't think a week's gonna do it.
L112438 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
L112437 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
L112436 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
L112435 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
L112434 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
L112433 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
L112432 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ I've never fired anyone in my life.
L112431 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
L112430 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
L112429 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
L112428 +++$+++ u4253 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CAPT. BARNEY +++$+++ What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
L112609 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ It's a miracle.
L112608 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You can trust me on this one.
L112607 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ Es impossible.
L112606 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She's having a baby. Twins.
L112605 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ Is she dying?
L112589 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Thanks for the translation.  What's your name? Nombre?
L112588 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ She say she in great pain.
L112587 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
L112586 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
L112585 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ No, no, that's impossible.
L112584 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Pregnant.
L112583 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
L112597 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ We are virgins.
L112596 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ No underwear?
L112595 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
L112594 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ In that time, you ever have sex?
L112593 +++$+++ u4254 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ CARLOS +++$+++ Two years. Ever since we left island.
L112592 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ You know each other a long time?
L112717 +++$+++ u4260 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ KANITA +++$+++ Stressed? He's psycho.
L112716 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
L112715 +++$+++ u4260 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ KANITA +++$+++ He flipped out.
L112714 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Frank, take it easy. what happened?
L112674 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ He's not a cop, he's a medic.  I'm CY Coates.
L112673 +++$+++ u4260 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ KANITA +++$+++ He looks like a cop.
L112672 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
L112667 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Mary ...
L112666 +++$+++ u4260 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ KANITA +++$+++ Hey Cy, guess who's here?
L112837 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
L112836 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No.
L112835 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
L112834 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Dead.
L112833 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ What about Kanita?
L112832 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I was tired. I needed a coffee.
L112831 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
L112830 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You're going to live.
L112829 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ So, Frank, am I going to live?
L112828 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ I can't hold up my head anymore.
L112827 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
L112825 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ No!
L112824 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Does that hurt?
L112700 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Just take it easy.
L112699 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I guess I'll be going.
L112697 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
L112696 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Is this what you gave Mary?
L112695 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Sleep is all stress reduction. Here.  You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need.  Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health?  You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water.
L112694 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I should be going. I just quit.
L112693 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
L112692 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
L112691 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
L112690 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Got a beer?
L112689 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
L112687 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mary, we really have to go.
L112686 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ She wanted something to help her sleep.
L112681 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I better just go in and see her.
L112680 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
L112679 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She asked me to pick her up.
L112678 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Sleeping in the back.
L112677 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Where is she?
L112676 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Mary said you might be coming.
L112675 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Frank Pierce.
L112639 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Ten-four.
L112638 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
L112637 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
L112580 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Ten-four, hon.
L112579 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
L112578 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
L112577 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
L112576 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
L112575 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
L112456 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
L112455 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
L112454 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
L112453 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
L112472 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
L112471 +++$+++ u4257 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DRUMMER +++$+++ IB Bangin.
L112470 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ What's his name?
L112469 +++$+++ u4257 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DRUMMER +++$+++ All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
L112462 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
L112461 +++$+++ u4257 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DRUMMER +++$+++ No way, man.
L112460 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ No. He's dead.
L112459 +++$+++ u4257 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DRUMMER +++$+++ He's going to be all right, right?
L112458 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Okay, what happened?
L112908 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows what's coming. He steps in, smash, over the green monster.
L112907 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Oh man, Bucky.
L112906 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
L112905 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah?
L112904 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Sure, sure, give go.
L112903 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No, I'd better not.
L112902 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Here, you try.
L112901 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
L112900 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
L112389 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.
L112388 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ What did you say?
L112387 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You're not going to die.
L112364 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
L112363 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
L112362 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
L112359 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ No, no medicine!
L112358 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
L112357 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
L112226 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
L112225 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
L112944 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Come on up.
L112943 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Frank.
L112942 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Who is it?
L112870 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ There's no time.
L112869 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ This is not a good time.
L112866 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
L112865 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
L112864 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
L112863 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
L112862 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
L112861 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
L112860 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
L112859 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
L112858 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He'll be all right.
L112857 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
L112729 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
L112728 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I need to sit down a minute.
L112727 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
L112724 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Because you can barely walk.
L112723 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
L112685 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, no.
L112684 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
L112664 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault.
L112663 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
L112662 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
L112661 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Fifteen minutes.
L112660 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Promise you won't go inside.
L112659 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You asked me not to come.
L112658 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I shouldn't have asked you to come.
L112657 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
L112656 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
L112655 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
L112654 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Maybe I should come up with you.
L112653 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
L112652 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Okay.
L112651 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
L112650 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Don't seem so bad to me.
L112649 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
L112648 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
L112558 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Sure.
L112557 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
L112556 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
L112555 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
L112554 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I think I'd remember that.
L112553 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
L112552 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
L112551 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
L112550 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Five years.
L112549 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ How long you been doing this?
L112548 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
L112545 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
L112544 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You married?
L112543 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
L112542 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
L112541 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We moved out after that. Upstate.
L112540 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
L112539 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
L112538 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
L112537 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
L112536 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Not as good as Nino's.
L112535 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
L112534 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
L112530 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
L112529 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's better.
L112528 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He's better, though, right?
L112527 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
L112526 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
L112525 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
L112512 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Okay.
L112511 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
L112510 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you.
L112509 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
L112508 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sleeping.
L112507 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How is she?
L112506 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
L112505 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I think it looks good.
L112504 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
L112503 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You look so different.
L112502 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
L112501 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
L112500 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He's better, isn't he?
L112499 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'll be right down.
L112498 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
L112497 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes?
L112415 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
L112414 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She should go home.
L112413 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
L112412 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
L112411 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's working a double shift.
L112410 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
L112409 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No.
L112408 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Did you see my father?
L112407 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Our Lady of Misery.
L112406 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I think this place stinks.
L112405 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes.
L112404 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He's dead, huh?
L112403 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes.
L112402 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
L112400 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
L112399 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
L112398 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You shouldn't smoke.
L112333 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
L112332 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
L112331 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
L112330 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
L112329 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
L112328 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ At least he's got people around him.
L112327 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
L112326 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You never know.
L112325 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
L112324 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The first is always the best.
L112323 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's my first cigarette in over a year.
L112258 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
L112257 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
L112253 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I guess there's always a chance.
L112252 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Is there any chance?
L112251 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We'd better go outside. Quickly.
L112250 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I know him. That's Noel.
L112249 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's very very sick.
L112207 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ His heart's beating.
L112206 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Is he going to be alright?
L112201 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ John, play the Sinatra.
L112200 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
L112199 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What?
L112198 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Do you have any music?
L112644 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ You can't leave me now.
L112643 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I quit! I'm through!
L112642 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Where you going?
L112634 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Greatest job in the world.
L112633 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Here's to the greatest job in the world.
L112632 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'll drink to that.
L112631 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
L112630 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I hate vodka.
L112628 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding.
L112627 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
L112626 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
L112625 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ What look?
L112624 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Don't give me that look.
L112604 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ It's coming.
L112603 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Backup?
L112602 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ That's too many.
L112601 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Three legs.
L112600 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ What's that, Frank?
L112599 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's coming.  Hold her down.
L112582 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What's wrong.
L112581 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
L112574 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I need a drink, that's all.
L112573 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
L112570 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
L112569 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
L112568 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She's no whore, Marcus.
L112567 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
L112562 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ You don't know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. Come on, let's go look at some hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting out.  Don't ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. They get real mad.
L112561 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
L112560 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
L112532 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Thanks.
L112531 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
L112517 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ God help us, he's hungry too.
L112516 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
L112515 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
L112514 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
L112513 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Who's that?
L112495 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Make a left here. I want to stop.
L112494 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
L112493 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
L112492 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
L112464 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
L112463 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
L112452 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ She loves me the way no woman ever has.
L112451 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
L112450 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
L112447 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here. 
L112446 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I think the worst is over.
L112445 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
L112444 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The ghosts--
L112443 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
L112442 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
L112441 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
L112932 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
L112931 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Where's Burke?
L112930 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Crazy fucker.
L112929 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No.
L112928 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
L112927 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Last show of the night.
L112853 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ A medical miracle.
L112852 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
L112851 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
L112850 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
L112849 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How many times have you shocked him tonight?
L112848 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ You can't believe how much he's improved.
L112614 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
L112613 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
L112490 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
L112489 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The family know?
L112488 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
L112487 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What do you think?
L112486 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
L112485 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
L112240 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
L112239 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He one of them?
L112232 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
L112231 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He got better.
L112952 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes.
L112951 +++$+++ u4266 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ ROSE/MARY +++$+++ Would you like to come in?
L112950 +++$+++ u4266 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ ROSE/MARY +++$+++ You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
L112949 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L112948 +++$+++ u4266 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ ROSE/MARY +++$+++ He was tough. You did all you could.
L112947 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
L112946 +++$+++ u4266 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ ROSE/MARY +++$+++ How can that be? He was getting better.
L112945 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
L112923 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ You're crazy.
L112922 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
L112921 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Frank!
L112920 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Do it!
L112919 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Frank!
L112918 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
L112898 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You learn that in the army?
L112897 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
L112896 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's ridiculous.
L112895 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
L112894 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Okay, whatta I do?
L112893 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
L112892 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
L112891 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's crazy. He can't help it.
L112890 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
L112887 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Let me think.
L112886 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
L112885 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
L112884 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
L112883 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Why?
L112882 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't know--let's break some windows.
L112881 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ What do you want to break?
L112880 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
L112879 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die.
L112878 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Who with?
L112877 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Let's get in a fight, then.
L112876 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
L112875 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
L112873 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
L112872 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
L112871 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
L112823 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
L112822 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How's he doing?
L112821 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
L112820 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
L112819 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
L112809 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Better bring it all.
L112808 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Whadda we bring?
L112803 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ That's all right, we're not meant to do Oh tonight. Something is going to happen. I can feel it.
L112802 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's early for him.
L112801 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Mr. Oh.
L112796 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I never felt better in my life.
L112795 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ You okay?
L112794 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I've taken that into consideration.
L112793 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ The brakes are shot.
L112792 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
L112791 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Whatja doing?
L112790 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
L112789 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Where you going?
L112773 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Look out!
L112772 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
L112768 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
L112767 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
L112766 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
L112765 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
L112764 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
L112763 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
L112762 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Yeah. Great, isn't it?
L112761 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ These are hard times, Tom.
L112760 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
L112759 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
L112372 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
L112371 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
L112713 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No way!
L112712 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Stomach again.
L112711 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ One more time!
L112710 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You're in the stomach! Let me try.
L112705 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You sure?
L112704 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You're in the stomach!
L112367 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Used to be my partner.
L112366 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
L112356 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You really think so?
L112355 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ He's crazy.
L112346 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
L112345 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
L112344 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah, you're right.
L112343 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
L112342 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
L112341 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
L112340 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
L112337 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Relax, will you.
L112336 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
L112315 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Faster!
L112314 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Faster! God!
L112306 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ He's drunk.
L112305 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well why didn't you say so?
L112301 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
L112300 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ They'll just keep calling.
L112299 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
L112298 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
L112291 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
L112290 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mr. Oh.
L112285 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You're burned out.
L112284 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Don't push it, Larry.
L112283 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
L112282 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
L112279 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You know what. The radio.
L112278 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What?
L112277 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Turn it off.
L112273 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
L112272 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
L112271 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
L112270 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm not hungry.
L112269 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
L112268 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What?
L112267 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Oh no!--I just remembered.
L112263 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on 3rd.
L112262 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
L112261 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's  been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
L112205 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ No shit.
L112204 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No we can't. He's got a pulse.
L112297 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Ten-four.  Don't go. Not this time.
L112296 +++$+++ u4265 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ RADIO DISPATCHER +++$+++ Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
L112295 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
L112294 +++$+++ u4265 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ RADIO DISPATCHER +++$+++ Thirteen Zebra. One-Three Zebra. You're going out of service in two seconds.
L112293 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there?  Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else.
L112292 +++$+++ u4265 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ RADIO DISPATCHER +++$+++ Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time.
L112289 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
L112288 +++$+++ u4265 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ RADIO DISPATCHER +++$+++ Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
L112287 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
L112286 +++$+++ u4265 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ RADIO DISPATCHER +++$+++ One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
L146393 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ Oh?
L146392 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
L146391 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ It was just a little going-away gesture.
L146390 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
L146389 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
L146377 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
L146376 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
L146375 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ What?
L146374 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ Then, you should call.
L146373 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
L146372 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
L146371 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
L146196 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
L146195 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
L146194 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I don't want to hear anymore.
L146193 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
L146192 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
L146191 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 
L146190 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
L146189 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
L146188 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
L146187 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
L146186 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
L146185 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
L146184 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
L146117 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I miss Beast a lot, too.
L146116 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
L146115 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
L146114 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
L146037 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
L146036 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Do we have to talk about this?
L145954 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I don't think you understand.    I won't wait.
L145953 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
L145952 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I want to see my mother immediately.
L145951 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
L145950 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ What kind of place is this?
L145949 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ What?
L145948 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ Patient.
L145947 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
L145946 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
L145945 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Yeah, and a dimple.
L145944 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
L145943 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
L145942 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
L145941 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ It's hospital policy...
L145940 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I did this already.
L145939 +++$+++ u4645 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ DR. EMLEE +++$+++ Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
L146586 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ I know.    I know.
L146585 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
L146584 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I can't.    I can't see him there.
L146583 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
L146582 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ But what am I going to do?
L146581 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
L146580 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
L146577 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I ruined your wedding night.
L146576 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ You did the right thing.
L146533 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ That's thanks to all your help.
L146532 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
L146140 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I didn't say...
L146139 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ What's his name, Letty?
L146135 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Oh, no, of course not.
L146134 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Do we have to talk wedding details?
L146133 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
L146132 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Ecru.
L146131 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ What do you think?
L146130 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
L146129 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You're slowing.
L146128 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
L146127 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ That settles it. I'm never leaving.
L146126 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
L146125 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
L145896 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'll be back before you can say souffle.
L145895 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
L145887 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
L145886 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ It'll be fine.
L145885 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
L145884 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ What's all the dreck?
L145881 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ What's the matter?
L145880 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Fuck me.
L145877 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
L145876 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
L145875 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ How can I help?
L145855 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Do you think I should?
L145854 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
L145845 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
L145844 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Hi, Mom.
L145843 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Truly.
L145842 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Really?
L145841 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You look beautiful.
L145840 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ What about this one?
L145838 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
L145837 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
L145836 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ What about the engagement party?
L145835 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Yeah, everything's under control.
L145834 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ But everything's OK?
L145833 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Things have been kind of stressful lately.
L145831 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'd have to see it on.
L145830 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ What do you think of this one?
L145829 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ She said she'd be here at 10.
L145828 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
L145778 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Yeah, it'll be fun.
L145777 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ And the party?
L145776 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
L145775 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Really?
L145774 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
L145773 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
L145772 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Please, Letty.
L145771 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
L145770 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
L145769 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Maybe.
L145768 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
L145767 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
L145766 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ How?
L145765 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
L145764 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
L145729 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
L145728 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
L145725 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ There's nothing to tell.
L145724 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Just go ahead and tell us.
L145720 +++$+++ u4653 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
L145719 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ What's up with you?
L146522 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Just remember that I love him.
L146521 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Don't be fresh.
L146520 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
L146518 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy after you've been locked away.
L146517 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
L146516 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
L146386 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ A deal's a deal.
L146385 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Honestly, Letty.
L146383 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Not even if it's something positive?
L146382 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
L146381 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I've already made arrangements.
L146380 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
L146379 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ It's good exercise, Mom.
L146378 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Must you walk so quickly?
L146259 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
L146258 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ I'm only looking out for you.
L146257 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
L146256 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
L146255 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Mom, please.
L146254 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
L146251 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ When did you start smoking?
L146250 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I haven't had a crush since I was
L146249 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
L146248 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
L146246 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
L146245 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
L146244 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
L146243 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Which flowers did you order?
L146241 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ You're looking good.    A little thin, but good.
L146240 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You too, Mom.
L146239 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
L146007 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ As soon as Dr. Emlee says.
L146006 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Tomorrow?
L146005 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ I'll see you soon.
L146001 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Paul said he'd call the school.  And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.
L146000 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
L145999 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Ruth's already taken him home.
L145998 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
L145997 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Yes.
L145996 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
L145995 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
L145994 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
L145993 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
L145992 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
L145991 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
L145990 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
L145989 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Oh, Letty, what happened?
L145988 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
L145987 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
L145859 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Can I get you a glass of champagne?
L145858 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ I gather he's late as usual.
L145853 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Especially with a promotion in the offing.
L145852 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Mom, please.
L145851 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Paul could pop the question at any time.
L145850 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Oh no.
L145848 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
L145847 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Has Paul heard about his promotion?
L145736 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You've only known Jake a few months.
L145735 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Tell us every detail.
L145733 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Wow.   Congratulations.
L145732 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
L145727 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Come on.
L145726 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Are you sure, Dear?
L145718 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
L145717 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ Will you get time off to do that?
L145716 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'll be running it three days a week, and...
L145715 +++$+++ u4649 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. MAYER +++$+++ How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
L146175 +++$+++ u4650 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ NURSE GATES +++$+++ I'm glad.
L146174 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
L146173 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I guess so. I think that's right.
L146172 +++$+++ u4650 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ NURSE GATES +++$+++ You can only do what feels best to you now.
L146168 +++$+++ u4650 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ NURSE GATES +++$+++ It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
L146167 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I don't mean to go on and on like this.
L146162 +++$+++ u4650 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ NURSE GATES +++$+++ I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
L146161 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
L146160 +++$+++ u4650 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ NURSE GATES +++$+++ If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
L146159 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Lie?
L146158 +++$+++ u4650 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ NURSE GATES +++$+++ I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
L146157 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Mottled really.   Green and red.
L146156 +++$+++ u4650 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ NURSE GATES +++$+++ Green spot.
L146155 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ It had this red spot on its back.
L146153 +++$+++ u4650 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ NURSE GATES +++$+++ Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out.
L146152 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
L146151 +++$+++ u4650 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ NURSE GATES +++$+++ Yeah?
L146150 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ There's a spider in my room.
L146149 +++$+++ u4650 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ NURSE GATES +++$+++ Letty, you should be in bed.
L145972 +++$+++ u4650 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ NURSE GATES +++$+++ Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
L145971 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm really not that hungry.
L146642 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You should go.
L146641 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I guess I should go now.
L146639 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
L146638 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
L146637 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
L146636 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How about something better?   Like a kiss.
L146635 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
L146634 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
L146633 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
L146632 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
L146631 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I love you so much.
L146628 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I know I don't want to lose you.     I don't think I could stand it.
L146627 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What do you want to do?
L146626 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ What are we going to do?
L146625 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
L146624 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
L146623 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
L146622 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I don't know. I don't fucking know.
L146621 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Well then why'd it happen?
L146620 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
L146619 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
L146618 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
L146617 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Letty, please.
L146616 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
L146615 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yeah, the plans.
L146614 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ And all the plans we have.
L146613 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I sure know what that feels like.
L146611 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ It's hard to know where to start.
L146610 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I guess so.
L146609 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I guess we need to talk.
L146569 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
L146568 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
L146567 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I think I should call someone.
L146566 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Silly, silly, silly.
L146565 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Michael, take it easy.
L146564 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Silly?   Silly am I?
L146563 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.
L146562 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Why'd you tell?
L146561 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ What do you mean not taking your meds?
L146560 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
L146559 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I saw you talking to my Mom.
L146558 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ What?
L146557 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Always the drugs.
L146556 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ What is it? Are you OK?
L146549 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It wasn't exactly a lie.
L146548 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
L146546 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How about a dance?
L146545 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
L146544 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Something like that.
L146530 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Bingo.
L146529 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Aunt Lily?
L146527 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
L146526 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
L146525 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
L146524 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
L146514 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Congratulations.
L146513 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How may I help you?
L146512 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I got worried. Are you OK?
L146511 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
L146501 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Coming.
L146500 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You're going to miss the Top Ten.
L146499 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
L146498 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
L146496 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You don't have to take care of me, you know.
L146495 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
L146494 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I couldn't even face that one.
L146493 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ The restaurant, too?
L146492 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Four interviews. Four no-gos.
L146480 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
L146479 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Are you OK?
L146478 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I think I should go home.
L146477 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
L146476 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
L146475 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You got wine. That's great.
L146474 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The store was busy.
L146469 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Steak?
L146468 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Promise.  As long as we have steak.
L146467 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Promise?
L146466 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
L146465 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Who ever said sanity was fun?
L146464 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Yeah.    How was the job search?
L146463 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Sounds grim.
L146462 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
L146461 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ That's Mr. Beast to you.
L146460 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ This must be Beast.
L146459 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Thanks.
L146458 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
L146439 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You've got one hell of a great body.
L146438 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Yeah?
L146437 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
L146435 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You, too. Kick ass today.
L146434 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Good luck.
L146433 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'll see you tonight.
L146432 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
L146430 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'll be forced to tickle you.
L146429 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Not yet.
L146427 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Shhhh.
L146426 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Michael.
L146425 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No.
L146424 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
L146422 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ It's sex time.
L146421 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey.
L146420 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You're so wrong.
L146419 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I like it.     But Headlines are better.
L146418 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ How can you not like the Top 10 List?
L146417 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
L146416 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
L146415 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Really?
L146414 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I love your apartment.
L146413 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Do you like it?
L146412 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You've got to see the kitchen first.
L146411 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Let's try out the bed.
L146410 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
L146409 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ It's TV heaven.
L146408 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Very trendy. Let's see the rest.
L146407 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
L146406 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I love the pillows.
L146405 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You like it?
L146404 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Wow.
L146402 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Open up.    I want to see.
L146401 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
L146400 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
L146399 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Where to?
L146398 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Aren't you ever quiet?
L146397 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
L146362 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ List schmist. You'll remember.
L146361 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I better make a list.
L146360 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
L146359 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No, I need some serious household advice.
L146358 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Furnished?
L146357 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ All over.  Did you see your new apartment?
L146356 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ So, it's over?
L146355 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Yeah.
L146354 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
L146353 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Just checking.
L146352 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ And did you go to the mission?
L146351 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Not a one.
L146350 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ So there were no problems?
L146349 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
L146348 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Tell me all.
L146346 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Home free.
L146345 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Well?
L146309 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.
L146308 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
L146307 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
L146305 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ But I do.     I love you, too.
L146304 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
L146303 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Michael, I...
L146302 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I do.
L146301 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Do you?
L146300 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
L146299 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Your family just met me.
L146298 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's a good thing my family loves you.
L146297 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Lie down.
L146296 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Then it's over.
L146295 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I don't like lamb.
L146294 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Tell the doctor.
L146293 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I have a terrible confession.
L146292 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
L146291 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
L146290 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
L146289 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ What else would you do?
L146287 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ That's where I always go when I get out.
L146286 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No way.
L146285 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The mission up in Santa Barbara.
L146284 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
L146283 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
L146216 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Break up?    They wish.
L146215 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
L146214 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ My Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light.  But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones.
L146213 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
L146212 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I wish I could have seen that.
L146211 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
L146210 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Shocking, huh?
L146209 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ What are the delusions like?
L146208 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
L146207 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
L146206 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What's my rap?
L146205 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Wow.    I'm bad news.
L146204 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
L146203 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Really?    Me too.
L146202 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
L146201 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
L146200 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
L146199 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ A rose is a rose.
L146198 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ The lady knows this is a dandelion.
L146197 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ A daisy for the lady.
L146148 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
L146147 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous.
L146146 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
L146145 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No rounds for another three hours.
L146144 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ We'll get caught.
L146143 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Exactly.
L146142 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ We're supposed to be asleep.
L146109 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
L146108 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No.
L146107 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
L146106 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ A small price.
L146105 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Good God.
L146104 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ For a price.
L146103 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ OK, OK, I'll give it back.
L146102 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Really, this isn't funny.
L146098 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ The left one.
L146097 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Guess.
L146096 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Enough with the abracadabra.
L146095 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Guess which hand.
L146093 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's magic.
L146092 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ What have you done with the ring?
L146091 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ So are you engaged, or what?
L146090 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
L146089 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Very romantic setting.
L146088 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ He asked me to marry him.
L146087 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Paul.
L146086 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
L146085 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
L146084 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
L146083 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I wasn't hungry.
L146082 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
L146044 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I've already checked it out 17 times.
L146043 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ But you're checking it out.
L146042 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Anything interesting.
L146041 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What are you looking to read?
L146019 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
L146018 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
L146017 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
L146016 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Don't take it personally.
L146015 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Who do you think you are?
L146014 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's no big deal.   We all compare.
L146013 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You took bets on my diagnosis?
L146012 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
L145937 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ That must be really difficult.
L145936 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ A while, I guess.
L145935 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
L145934 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What if it's got a pattern?
L145933 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ By color.
L145932 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
L145931 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
L145930 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yes?   Go right ahead.
L145928 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
L145927 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No.
L145926 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
L145925 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Terrific.
L145924 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Chair, cup and ball.
L145923 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
L145922 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
L145918 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night.
L145917 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I answered these questions last night.
L145916 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
L145915 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Letty.
L145914 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
L146602 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Sure, I understand.
L146601 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
L146600 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm really sorry.
L146599 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I think I've heard this speech before.
L146598 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
L146597 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Michael.   Yes.
L146596 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
L146595 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ What?
L146594 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I heard about your friend.
L146593 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Getting back.
L146592 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I start on Monday.
L146591 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ How's work going?    Are you back at school?
L146590 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Oh.
L146589 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
L146588 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
L146587 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm glad you agreed to see me.
L146342 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses.
L146341 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Here's the ring.
L146340 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
L146339 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I love him.
L146338 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
L146337 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ He's a patient here.
L146336 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
L146335 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No.
L146334 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Have you been seeing another teacher?
L146333 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ It doesn't matter who.
L146332 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Who?
L146331 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I've met someone else.
L146330 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
L146329 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
L146328 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You what?
L146327 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ That's a load off my mind.
L146326 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No...
L146325 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You can tell me anything.  Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
L146324 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
L146323 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
L146081 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
L146080 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So will you?
L146079 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No, no.
L146078 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
L146077 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So, what do you say, Let?
L146076 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No, you've done a perfect job.
L146075 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ It's, it's really nice, Paul.
L146074 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
L146073 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
L146072 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
L146070 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I just wish we'd done it sooner.
L146069 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
L146068 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
L146067 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
L146066 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
L146065 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So, I've been thinking a lot...
L146064 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Especially now.
L146063 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Especially this last year.
L146062 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No.
L146061 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ This has been really difficult, this whole thing. 
L146060 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Yes, I suppose so.
L146059 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I think we need to talk about some things.
L146058 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
L146057 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Something you did?
L146056 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I hope it wasn't something I did.
L146055 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ That's a big question.
L146054 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Are you all right?
L146053 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Yeah, I guess it's all right.
L146052 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
L145894 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I think you're overreacting.
L145893 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm going to the store.
L145892 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sure. Why?
L145891 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Can you loan me a 20?
L145890 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What are you doing?
L145872 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes.
L145871 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
L145811 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You just need to get more organized. L
L145810 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Yeah.
L145809 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
L145808 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I don't think so.
L145807 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
L145806 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
L145805 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You can get out of the dinner.
L145804 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
L145803 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ No, it's not like that.
L145802 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
L145801 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
L145800 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Forget I asked.
L145799 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
L145798 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ But what about that math project?
L145797 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late?
L145796 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I don't feel like going to work today.
L145795 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You don't have a fever.
L145794 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I'm calling in sick.
L145793 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
L145756 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Sure. Of course.
L145755 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
L145754 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Oh, ok.   Maybe.
L145753 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
L145752 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I mean tonight.
L145751 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
L145750 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
L145749 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Yeah?
L145748 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Good going. I knew you could do it.
L145747 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
L145746 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
L145745 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
L145744 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
L145743 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
L145742 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Can I put these here for tonight?
L145741 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She's only known the guy a few months.
L145740 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
L145739 +++$+++ u4651 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So, another one bites the dust.
L146452 +++$+++ u4652 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL GAIL +++$+++ Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year.
L146451 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Office work?
L146450 +++$+++ u4652 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL GAIL +++$+++ I need someone to work on budget projections.
L146449 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ What does that mean?
L146448 +++$+++ u4652 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL GAIL +++$+++ It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
L146446 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.
L146445 +++$+++ u4652 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL GAIL +++$+++ I'm glad you're doing well.
L146444 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
L146443 +++$+++ u4652 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL GAIL +++$+++ I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
L146442 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
L146441 +++$+++ u4652 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL GAIL +++$+++ So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
L146440 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
L145701 +++$+++ u4646 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ LETTY +++$+++ I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
L145700 +++$+++ u4652 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL GAIL +++$+++ The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
L146266 +++$+++ u4648 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. HALLSTROM +++$+++ That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
L146265 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
L146182 +++$+++ u4648 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. HALLSTROM +++$+++ Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
L146181 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I like those sapphire earrings myself.
L146180 +++$+++ u4648 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. HALLSTROM +++$+++ Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
L146179 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How's it look?
L145967 +++$+++ u4647 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'll float you.
L145966 +++$+++ u4648 +++$+++ m308 +++$+++ MRS. HALLSTROM +++$+++ All tapped out.
L376243 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
L376242 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Dinner?  Again?
L376234 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Yeah, speak for yourself.
L376233 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Look who's talking.
L376182 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You think so?
L376181 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ -- But he does seem very nice.
L376179 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ ...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
L376178 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
L376177 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ ...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
L375870 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
L375869 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ That's your name?
L375862 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ ...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting.  What's on the table for discussion?  Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --
L375861 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ You ate?
L375860 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
L375522 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
L375521 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
L376271 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
L376270 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
L375894 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Very.
L375893 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ He's cute.
L375892 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ That was 'Joe'.
L375828 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Love that name.
L375827 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Just plain 'Joe'?
L375823 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
L375822 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Daddy!  Come on, a name.
L375740 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
L375739 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ His wife?
L375738 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ He's coming.
L375737 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Did you speak to the Governor?
L376615 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Yes, it is.
L376614 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
L376612 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
L376611 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I wasn't going to say --
L376610 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ That you've been to Susan?
L376609 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I haven't been the father to you that --
L376608 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love?
L376607 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
L376606 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
L376604 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ -- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
L376603 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Do they, m'dear?
L376602 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
L376601 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
L376600 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
L376355 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ 'Goddam party'!
L376354 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Oh, the goddam party --
L376353 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ It's for the party, Dad --
L376352 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't like cake.
L376351 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
L376350 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Who's Annie?
L376349 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Annie made them.
L376348 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What is this?
L376200 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ That's okay, Daddy.
L376199 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
L376198 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
L376197 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Of course.
L376196 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
L376195 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
L376194 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ From the Korean War.
L376193 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Who?
L376192 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
L375882 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ We've got some things to discuss.
L375881 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
L375836 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
L375835 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ -- Black.
L375819 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ A name?
L375818 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
L375730 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
L375729 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
L375728 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ And you could care less --
L375727 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I know you do, darling.
L375726 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
L375725 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What, honey?
L375529 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ No.
L375528 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
L375527 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
L375526 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I hate parties --
L375518 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ But it's your birthday.
L375517 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
L375516 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
L375515 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
L375514 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Have you got a minute?
L375513 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Hi, Allison --
L375512 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Daddy!
L376364 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ What will I tell Annie?
L376363 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ But what?
L376362 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Yeah, but --
L375845 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ You know what I'm saying, Joe?
L375844 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Honey --!
L375843 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
L375842 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Paillarde of veal.
L375749 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
L375748 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
L375746 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ He said he would be there with bells on.
L375745 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ What about the Mayor?
L375567 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends --
L375566 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
L375565 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Honey, please.
L376620 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Both.
L376619 +++$+++ u6545 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Red or white?
L376618 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
L376617 +++$+++ u6545 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
L375545 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ 9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
L375544 +++$+++ u6545 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
L375543 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ What do you do that for?
L375542 +++$+++ u6545 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
L375541 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ And that?
L375540 +++$+++ u6545 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ -- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
L375539 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ ...This shit's not bad.
L375640 +++$+++ u6546 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ BONTECOU +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
L375639 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I thought you were buying my company.
L375638 +++$+++ u6546 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ BONTECOU +++$+++ Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
L375637 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm sorry, I don't recall --
L375636 +++$+++ u6546 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ BONTECOU +++$+++ We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
L375635 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
L375634 +++$+++ u6546 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ BONTECOU +++$+++ Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
L376251 +++$+++ u6547 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ COYLE +++$+++ Right away.
L376250 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Toast?  No...just the butter.
L376249 +++$+++ u6547 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ COYLE +++$+++ How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
L376248 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I would prefer some peanut butter.
L375934 +++$+++ u6547 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ COYLE +++$+++ I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
L375933 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ 'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
L375932 +++$+++ u6547 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ COYLE +++$+++ You mean this, sir?
L375931 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What are you eating.
L375930 +++$+++ u6547 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ COYLE +++$+++ Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
L375929 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
L375928 +++$+++ u6547 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ COYLE +++$+++ Yes, sir?
L376397 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
L376396 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
L376395 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
L376299 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Yeah.  Goodnight.
L376298 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Well... goodnight.
L376297 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
L376296 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
L376295 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
L376294 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Drew, you're out of line.
L376293 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
L376292 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
L376291 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
L376290 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ ...See you tomorrow night.
L375884 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What 'business'?
L375883 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ -- Did I hear 'business'?
L375548 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Hi.
L375547 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Hello, Beautiful.
L376446 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ He'll wait --
L376445 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
L376444 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
L376337 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ Hello, Quince.
L376336 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Thank you for coming.
L376334 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Am I not obligated to?
L376333 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ You're taking this too far, Drew.
L376332 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
L376331 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ And what would that be?
L376770 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ The dagger --?
L376769 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
L376768 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I'm not stepping anywhere --
L376764 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ -- And now you're going to pee some more.
L376763 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
L376392 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
L376391 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No, I don't --
L376273 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
L376272 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Perhaps you could remind me.
L376268 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
L376267 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
L376266 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
L376265 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Who are we talking about?
L376231 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
L376230 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.
L376155 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes.
L376154 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ May I interrupting?
L376054 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Then why did you bring it up?
L376053 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ It doesn't matter.
L376052 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Of whom?
L376051 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
L376050 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What an odd pairing.
L376049 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Yes.
L376048 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ "Death and Taxes"?
L376047 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Yes.
L376038 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ And a glass.
L376037 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Cold.
L376036 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Hot or cold.
L376035 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Why yes, thank you.
L376034 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
L376033 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
L376032 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
L376031 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thank you.
L376030 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
L375873 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ 'Here'?
L375872 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Here...
L375871 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
L375858 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
L375857 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I didn't say.
L375856 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ What side of the industry did you say you were on?
L375855 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We have an arrangement now.
L376788 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
L376787 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
L376786 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You get not to go to jail.
L376785 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ And what do I get?
L376784 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
L376783 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
L376761 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
L376760 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
L376759 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
L376452 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
L376451 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ In English, please.
L376450 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
L376449 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
L376443 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Are you running this Board or am I?
L376442 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Certainly, Bill.
L376441 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
L376440 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
L376439 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
L376438 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Don't you want to hear the details?
L376437 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ The answer is no, quick enough for you?
L376436 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Bontecou wants a quick response and --
L376435 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ That's it?
L376433 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't think so.  Do you?
L376432 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
L376388 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Certainly.  Goodnight.
L376387 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I think it's time you went home, Drew.
L376386 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
L376385 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
L376384 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Yours.
L376383 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Whose?
L376382 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
L376381 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't care.
L376380 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
L376379 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Over my dead body.
L376378 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
L376377 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What are their feelings?
L376376 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
L376375 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
L376279 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Sure.
L376278 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
L376277 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
L376259 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Please, Drew.
L376258 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Mind if I throw up?
L376226 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Please.  Don't worry about him.  And above all, don't antagonize him.
L376225 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ For how long?  And why?
L376224 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
L376223 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ As much as Joe's?
L376222 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
L376167 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.
L376166 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I thought this was practically a done deal --
L376165 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
L376163 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
L376162 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Why?
L376161 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ How nice for you both.
L376160 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
L376159 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
L376158 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Sit down, Drew.
L376157 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ 'Just kidding'?
L376156 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ No.
L376059 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
L376058 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Shall we adjourn?
L376057 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Glad I could be of some help.
L376056 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I am now.
L376055 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
L376045 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ That's your privilege, Bill.  But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu- ture, the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes.
L376044 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
L376043 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ ...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
L375854 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I get the feeling you've done some business before.
L375853 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ No --
L375849 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Uh -- he's from out of town --
L375848 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Have we met?
L375834 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
L375833 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What do you mean?
L375832 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Is there any more to it?
L375831 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes.
L375830 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ 'Joe...'
L375825 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ What?!
L375824 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
L375821 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
L375820 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Yeah, something he goes by --
L375679 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Olympic.
L375678 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ As close as a deal could be.
L375677 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
L375674 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ You have a way with words.
L375673 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Like a marriage made in heaven?
L375672 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
L375671 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Me, too.
L375670 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I'm all excited --
L375633 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
L375632 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
L375630 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
L375629 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Do you think I need a haircut?
L375628 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ It's going to be great --
L375627 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Sounds good.
L375626 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ ...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?
L375615 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ No no, not you.
L375614 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
L375613 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Did you just hear something?
L375612 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I was saying to Quince we won't need --
L375557 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Maybe, who knows?  You know how voices are.  Let's go.
L375556 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ 'Yes' to the deal?
L375555 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ 'Yes'.
L375554 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ What'd it say?
L375553 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ In my sleep.
L375552 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ A voice?
L375551 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ 'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
L375550 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
L375549 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.
L376753 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
L376752 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
L376751 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ He said that?
L376750 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
L376749 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
L376469 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
L376468 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
L376467 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
L376466 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ But I didn't mean to do it!
L376465 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
L376464 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ I'm going to put a stop to this!
L376463 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
L376462 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
L376347 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ That's what he said.
L376346 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ 'It's up to Joe'?
L376345 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
L376344 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ -- But he was concerned about the timing?
L376343 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ He was interested.
L376342 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
L376341 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
L376275 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
L376274 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.
L376212 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Yeah.  Neat.
L376211 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
L376210 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Well, that's very interesting.
L376209 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Yeah, that's what he said.
L376208 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ 'It's up to Joe', huh?
L376207 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Yeah.
L376206 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ 'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
L376205 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
L376204 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Are you?
L376203 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
L376202 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Thanks, Quince.
L376201 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ ...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
L375868 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Joe, you do get around.
L375867 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Well, I guess he's found one.
L375755 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
L375754 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ You're overthinking it --
L375609 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ I know.  Gum up the works.
L375608 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
L375607 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
L376551 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Can do no right by people.  Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!

L376429 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What?
L376428 +++$+++ u6550 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ The Board is waiting.
L376427 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Good morning, Jennifer.
L376426 +++$+++ u6550 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
L376024 +++$+++ u6550 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
L376023 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Jennifer.
L376022 +++$+++ u6550 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Didn't the family get together last night --?
L376021 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ -- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
L375707 +++$+++ u6550 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Nothing?
L375706 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ No.  Nothing.
L375705 +++$+++ u6550 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
L375704 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Sure.
L375703 +++$+++ u6550 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
L375676 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Hi, Jennifer.
L375675 +++$+++ u6550 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
L376645 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.
L376644 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
L376641 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
L376640 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ You think so?  How do you know?
L376638 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
L376637 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
L376636 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Free to love each other.  Com- pletely.  Totally.  No fear.
L376635 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What do you mean 'free'?
L376634 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
L376633 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ 'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
L376632 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
L376631 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ But she loves you?
L376630 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
L376629 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ How did you meet?
L376628 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Oh yes, I do.
L376627 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You love Allison, don't you?
L376626 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ 'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
L376625 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Love.
L376624 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Confused, huh?  About what?
L376623 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Do I?  I'm a little confused.
L376622 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
L376373 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're welcome.
L376372 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Thanks.
L376371 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ And you're a nice man, Quince.
L376370 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...
L376369 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
L376368 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ I didn't know that.
L376367 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
L376191 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
L376190 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That's very gracious of you, Quince.
L375886 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's so very nice to see you again.
L375885 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Don't bother asking, we already tried.
L375879 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Hey, this is fun.
L375878 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Black.
L375851 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ As long as it takes.
L375850 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ How long you here, Joe?
L375840 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Are you?
L375839 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
L375838 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes?
L375837 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ 'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
L376844 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
L376843 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You think so?
L376842 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
L376841 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ That's it?
L376738 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thank you for loving me.
L376737 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ -- Yes?
L376736 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Susan --
L376735 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Hold me --
L376734 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I love you now, I'll love you always --
L376733 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
L376732 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
L376731 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm still here.
L376726 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
L376725 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I - uh --
L376724 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ -- That was the place... and you were the guy.
L376723 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ The 'coffee shop' --
L376722 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
L376721 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Did I say that?
L376668 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yes, that's why I said it.
L376667 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I believe that, don't you?
L376666 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It's a saying.
L376665 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ 'Love will find out the way'?
L376664 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ 'Love will find out the way'.
L376663 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What will we do?
L376662 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
L376661 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Will it?
L376660 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Don't.  That will come later.
L376659 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ But there's so much to tell you --
L376658 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ We know all that we need to know --
L376657 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We know so little about each other --
L376656 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Then don't.
L376655 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
L376654 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It gets worse.
L376653 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
L376652 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ And you can't tell me who you are.
L376651 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well -- I --
L376650 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Where are you going?
L376649 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
L376648 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
L376647 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I love you in an evening gown.
L376646 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I like you in a black tie.
L376499 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh, I hope a long, long time.
L376498 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ For how long?
L376497 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Nowhere?  I'm...here.
L376496 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Where are you going?
L376495 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes!
L376494 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ More than you love peanut butter?
L376493 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I loved it.
L376492 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Did you like making love to me?
L376489 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Maybe it's the draft through the door.
L376488 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ ...No.
L376486 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
L376485 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
L376484 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ He's taking a nap.
L376482 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ How beautiful.
L376481 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
L376480 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I am.
L376479 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You're here?
L376418 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Faster.  And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
L376417 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ And is your heart beating strangely?
L376416 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
L376415 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I don't know who you are.
L376414 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes?
L376410 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Why, yes.  Thank you.
L376409 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
L376408 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ -- Could you?
L376407 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It was everything.
L376406 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thank you.
L376405 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ -- I guess you haven't.
L376404 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I love your smell.
L376402 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
L376401 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I'm sorry about --
L376399 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I said get out.
L376398 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Almost.
L376394 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Why don't you get off his case?
L376393 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You first.
L376315 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes.  I'm tired.
L376314 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ 'To bed'?
L376313 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ To bed.
L376312 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Where are you going?
L376309 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.
L376308 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Gay?
L376307 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.
L376306 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Girlfriend?
L376305 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No, I'm not.
L376304 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
L376303 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Why?
L376301 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
L376300 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ How long have you been standing there?
L376264 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm sorry to hear that.
L376263 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
L376262 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Has her pain abated?
L376261 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I am, too.
L376260 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
L376257 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes...I've found that it does.
L376256 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It comforts you, doesn't it?
L376255 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes...
L376254 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you?
L376253 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't know.
L376252 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Why do you love peanut butter so much?
L376220 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ And I appreciate you, too.
L376219 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I mean I appreciate that.
L376218 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Excuse me?
L376217 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I appreciate you --
L376216 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
L376215 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
L376214 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
L376213 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I wanted to apologize, Susan --
L376137 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Be sorry for nothing.
L376136 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
L376135 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not now.
L376134 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Joe, I'm with Drew.
L376128 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yes.
L376127 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ She's in a great deal of pain.
L376093 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't mind --
L376092 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Patients have visitors, not doctors.
L376091 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ And I'll be a visitor.
L376090 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
L376089 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Whatever you do.
L376088 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Watch me do what?
L376087 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Very well, I'll watch.
L376086 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
L376085 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I came to see you.
L376084 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Then why are you here, Joe?
L376083 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh goodness, no.
L376081 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
L376080 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Joe --
L375972 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
L375971 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes?
L375969 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Goodnight to you, Susan.
L375968 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Goodnight, Joe.
L375967 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
L375966 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yes?
L375965 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Susan?
L375964 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
L375963 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
L375962 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yes --?
L375960 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I can see why.
L375959 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't have any.
L375958 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I've got plenty of friends.
L375957 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
L375956 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
L375955 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
L375954 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
L375953 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
L375952 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Come again?
L375951 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Do you love Drew?
L375950 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ -- What kind of childhood did you have?
L375949 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I haven't.
L375948 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You act like you never had peanut butter before --
L375947 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Peanut butter.
L375946 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
L375945 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That is not my intention.
L375944 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
L375943 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I am Joe.
L375942 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
L375941 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ 'Big'?
L375939 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L375938 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ -- Can't seem to escape you today.
L375937 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm lost.
L375936 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L376834 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ That's life.  What can I tell you?
L376833 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes.
L376829 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes.
L376828 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I guess you have your reasons.
L376827 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not exactly.
L376826 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Thank you.
L376825 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Happy Birthday, Bill.
L376782 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ An indictable offense.
L376781 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ An offense --
L376780 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Undisclosed conflict of interest --
L376779 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
L376778 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ And we're very grateful.
L376777 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
L376775 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ -- An IRS man.
L376774 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'll take it from here --  I am --
L376773 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ He is --
L376772 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
L376771 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I told you to shut up.
L376767 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
L376766 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's time to put this person where he belongs.
L376765 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Joe, don't do this --
L376746 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Get him in here.
L376745 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Okay.
L376715 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
L376714 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Are you threatening me?
L376713 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't expect you to.
L376712 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't like what you're saying.
L376711 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Does she know where she's going?
L376710 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.
L376709 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
L376708 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
L376707 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well, they're mine now.
L376706 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Those were my words, Bill.
L376705 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
L376704 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ So that's what love is?
L376703 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
L376702 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Which is what?
L376701 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
L376700 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Then what is it?
L376699 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
L376698 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
L376697 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
L376696 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Bill --
L376695 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
L376694 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I think you heard me, Bill.
L376693 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You're what?
L376692 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
L376691 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Say again?
L376690 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ -- And I'm in love with your daughter.
L376689 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it.  And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.
L376688 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I was just asking, Bill.
L376687 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What the hell do you care?
L376686 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not at all.
L376685 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Thanks.
L376588 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
L376587 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yeah.
L376586 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You are?
L376585 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What are you saying, that it's time to go?
L376584 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ -- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
L376583 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes?
L376582 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Uh --
L376525 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I told you, 'watch it'.
L376524 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
L376523 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
L376522 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ And I don't give a shit.
L376521 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
L376520 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
L376519 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ This universe?
L376518 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You're violating the laws of the universe.
L376515 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct.  You've lived a first-rate life.  And I find it eminently usable.
L376514 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
L376513 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ 'Spooning'?
L376512 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
L376511 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
L376510 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm her father!
L376509 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'll be the judge of that.
L376508 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
L376507 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes, I saw you see me.
L376505 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm sorry to hear that.
L376504 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I couldn't sleep.
L376478 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Then I can't help you.
L376477 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm not hungry.
L376476 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going to take a nap.
L376475 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ 'Fish'?
L376474 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
L376473 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Just a manner of speaking.
L376472 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What's okay?
L376471 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ That's okay.
L376470 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Bill --
L376425 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Goodnight.
L376424 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Okay.  Goodnight.
L376423 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Um -- not right now.
L376422 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
L376421 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Hello, Bill.
L376289 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Are you going to fire me, Bill?
L376288 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
L376287 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You tell me, Bill.
L376286 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What way would you put it?
L376285 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I wouldn't put it that way.
L376284 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ About Susan?
L376283 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I guess...
L376282 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You were just curious?
L376281 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't know.
L376280 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Why did you go to the hospital?
L376176 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
L376175 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
L376174 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Okay.
L376173 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
L376172 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
L376170 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Absolutely.
L376169 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Dinner?  Absolutely.
L376152 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ This part I'm interested in.
L376151 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
L376150 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well...I don't know.
L376149 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Why didn't you stop me?
L376148 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ And more.
L376147 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
L376146 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L376145 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
L376144 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Truly - uh - splendid.
L376143 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
L376142 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Excellent.  What is it?
L376141 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ It's all yours.
L376140 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Are you going to eat your lunch
L376079 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
L376078 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
L376075 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh.  Okay.
L376074 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Now I'd like to be alone.
L376073 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Of course.
L376072 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
L376071 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
L376070 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
L376069 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Are you sad, Bill?
L376068 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ ...I'd like to be alone for a while.
L376067 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't understand.
L376066 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ -- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
L376040 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes.
L376039 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Would you like to sit down, Joe?
L376028 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
L376027 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
L376026 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.
L376025 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
L376016 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ So can I.
L376015 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes.
L376014 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Can you keep a secret?
L376013 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What's it like where I'm going?
L376012 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L376011 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What's it like?
L376010 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I understand.
L376009 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I want to live.
L376008 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That's what everybody says.
L376007 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm not everybody.
L376006 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That's what everybody says.
L376005 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ -- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
L376004 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not this.
L376003 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ There's one to every rule.
L376002 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Make an exception?
L376001 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ How about giving a guy a break?
L376000 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes, Bill.
L375999 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Joe --?
L375998 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
L375997 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Of course.
L375996 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
L375995 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I guess so.
L375994 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
L375993 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What do you mean?
L375992 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
L375989 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You've got a deal.
L375988 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes?
L375987 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Bill --
L375986 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
L375985 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ A 'deal'?
L375984 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ It is a deal?
L375983 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Sounds fair enough.
L375982 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ And I won't tell anyone who you are.
L375981 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ And what?
L375979 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
L375978 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
L375977 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ 'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
L375976 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ How are you?  How're you feeling?
L375975 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Good morning, Bill.
L375974 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Good morning.
L375922 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Good night to you, Bill.
L375921 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
L375920 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not at all.
L375919 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well, thank you for letting me know.
L375918 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Closer than that.
L375917 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
L375916 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ No --
L375915 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
L375914 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ ...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
L375913 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
L375912 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ When you go, I go.
L375911 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
L375910 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ How long have I got?
L375909 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I won't.
L375908 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
L375907 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.
L375906 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
L375905 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What a good idea.
L375902 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
L375901 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
L375900 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.
L375899 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ So there's nothing between you and Susan?
L375898 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
L375897 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
L375896 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ 'Threw' you?  Where?
L375895 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ ...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
L375891 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thank you.
L375890 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Joe, that's the kitchen.
L375847 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
L375846 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No --
L375811 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Then don't.
L375810 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
L375809 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Speak up, please.
L375808 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ It just occurred to me --
L375807 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Of course.
L375806 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Excuse me?  Could I say something?
L375805 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
L375804 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
L375801 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ And then --?
L375800 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ You should hope quite a while.
L375799 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I do?  How long will you be staying?
L375798 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ You fill the bill, Bill.
L375797 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You want me to be your guide --?
L375796 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?
L375795 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
L375794 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ That's me.
L375793 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Death!
L375792 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Yes.
L375790 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ '...Yes --'
L375789 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You are --?
L375788 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?
L375787 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ I am not a dream.
L375786 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
L375783 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Yes, Bill.  The question.
L375782 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ The 'question' --
L375781 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
L375780 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What question?
L375779 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ 'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
L375778 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes what?
L375777 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
L375776 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm sorry --
L375775 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Watch it!
L375774 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
L375773 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Time.
L375772 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Get what?
L375771 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
L375770 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ 'The one' to do what?
L375769 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
L375768 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ 'Take me'...?  Where?
L375767 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I want to have a look around before I take you.
L375766 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ About what?
L375765 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
L375764 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What the hell is this?  Who are you?
L375763 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
L375761 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Quiet.
L375760 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
L375759 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I'm here.
L375758 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Where are you?
L375701 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Know what?  Know what, goddammit!
L375700 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I think you know --
L375699 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What do you mean?!
L375698 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ There's going to be plenty of time for that.
L375697 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Please.  Talk to me --
L375696 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ It's enough now.
L375695 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Where are you?  Are you there?
L375694 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
L375693 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm sorry, I --
L375692 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Are you giving me orders?
L375690 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ What you were talking about.
L375689 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L375688 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
L375687 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't!
L375686 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I think you know --
L375684 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I believe you did.
L375683 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I didn't ask any question.
L375682 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ 'Yes' is the answer to your question.
L375681 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ 'Yes' what?
L375611 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What?
L375610 +++$+++ u6556 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ '...I know, it's none of my business.'
L376684 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Sir, I'll deliver the package.
L376683 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Quince, I've got confidence in you.
L376682 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ You think Drew will go for it?
L376681 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
L376676 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes, I believe I do.
L376675 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
L376674 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Sure.
L376673 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
L376671 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
L376670 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ ...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
L376366 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
L376365 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ This one.
L376361 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ See.  There.  What'd I tell you?
L376360 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yeah, I give a shit.
L376359 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
L376357 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
L376356 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
L376189 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
L376188 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
L376187 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Yeah.  Or the week after.
L376186 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Next week?
L376185 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
L376184 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Thank you, Quince.
L376183 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ ...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
L375564 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
L375563 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ How's that, Quince?
L375562 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ I am, this is it.  B Day.
L375561 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm doing great.  You ready?
L375560 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ How're you doing--?
L375559 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Good morning, Quince.
L375558 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Hi, Bill --
L376793 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
L376792 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
L376756 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ We're all ears.
L376755 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
L376754 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ We're all here, Bill --
L376599 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.
L376598 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
L376597 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
L376596 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
L376595 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
L376594 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
L376593 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
L376592 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
L376591 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Eddie?
L376461 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
L376460 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
L376459 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
L376458 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
L376457 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ ...It's not over, 'til it's over.
L376061 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
L376060 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
L376823 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ The fireworks are about to start.
L376822 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What was that?
L376817 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
L376816 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
L376815 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Oh, yes --
L376814 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
L376810 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ That's why it's okay.
L376809 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I love you, Daddy --
L376808 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
L376807 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Daddy --
L376806 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
L376805 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ But what?
L376804 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes, but --
L376803 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Are you relieved?
L376802 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L376801 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
L376800 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm having a helluva time.
L376799 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What a night.
L376574 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
L376573 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I love him.
L376572 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I just can't help you.  I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.
L376571 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
L376570 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't know, I can't say --
L376569 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Where's he going?
L376568 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
L376567 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
L376566 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You don't know anything about Joe --
L376565 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
L376564 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ This is crazy --
L376563 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.
L376562 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't understand.
L376561 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
L376560 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't know.
L376559 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Where is he?
L376558 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Joe?
L376557 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Where's Joe?
L376329 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It's something.
L376328 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Then what is it?
L376327 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
L376326 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Nothing.
L376325 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
L376324 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
L376323 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Then what will you say?
L376322 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
L376321 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
L376320 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
L376319 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Raise away.
L376318 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
L376317 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yeah, it's good to get together.
L376316 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ That was wonderful.
L376239 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Will it?...
L376238 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It'll come back, Daddy.
L375888 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
L375887 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
L375877 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
L375876 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
L375866 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ -- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
L375865 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What?!
L375864 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ We've met.
L375863 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You know each other?
L375625 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yer damn right.
L375624 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Well, go get 'em, Pops.
L375623 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
L375622 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Are you okay?
L375620 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Nothing.
L375619 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What is it, Daddy --?
L375617 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Nothing.  I'm sorry.
L375616 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Daddy, what's the matter?
L375606 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
L375605 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Thank God.
L375604 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
L375603 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You're terrible.
L375602 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
L375601 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
L375600 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
L375599 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
L375598 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Aw, you're tough.
L375597 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Bravo.
L375596 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
L375595 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ 'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
L375594 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
L375593 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ That's all?
L375592 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
L375591 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Don't get dirty, Dad --
L375590 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
L375589 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You're not listening --
L375588 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
L375587 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ So what's wrong with that?
L375586 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
L375585 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What were you going to say?
L375584 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Well, I wasn't going to say that --
L375583 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
L375582 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
L375581 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Uh oh --
L375580 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Don't get carried away.
L375579 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Probably.
L375578 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
L375577 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You mean like you loved Mom?
L375576 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Do you love Drew?
L375574 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I know it's none of my business --
L375573 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ ...There's a start for a meeting.
L375572 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I am.  With you.
L375571 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I thought you were in a meeting--?
L375570 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's get this day started.
L375569 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You're only six-five once.
L375568 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Not my birthday again?
L375538 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ ...Then don't.
L375537 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't like to interfere.
L375536 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yeah.  I guess so.
L375535 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You like him, don't you?
L375534 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I hope so.
L375533 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Does Drew tell you everything?
L375532 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Drew told me.
L375531 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ How did you know?
L375530 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
L375524 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
L375523 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Drew's aboard?
L375520 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Hi, honey.
L375519 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Good morning, Dad.
L376855 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ But we've got time.
L376854 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ ...We know so little about each other.
L376851 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Y'didn't?
L376850 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ No --
L376849 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ You said you liked me.
L375723 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go.
L375722 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Why not?
L375721 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
L375720 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
L375719 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Why?
L375718 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
L375717 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ No, it was so right it scares me.
L375716 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Did I say something wrong?
L375715 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I've got to go --
L375714 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ You never know.  Lightning could strike.
L375713 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
L375712 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ I would.
L375711 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
L375710 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
L375709 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ 'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
L375708 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ ...It's kind of a pro bono job.
L375669 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
L375668 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I've got patients coming in --
L375667 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ How 'bout another cup of coffee?
L375666 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Not at all.
L375665 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ -- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
L375664 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
L375663 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ 'Her'.
L375662 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I could be her.
L375661 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
L375660 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Me?  Internal medicine.
L375659 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
L375658 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ How'd you know?
L375657 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Damn right.  Looking for her right now.  Who knows?  You might be her.
L375656 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ So you're a one-girl guy?
L375655 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
L375654 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
L375653 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Why?
L375652 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I agree --
L375651 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Nothing lasts.
L375650 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What's the way?
L375649 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
L375648 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I'm sorry --
L375647 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
L375646 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You and 'Honey'?
L375645 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
L375644 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Not at all.  It was fascinating.
L375643 +++$+++ u6557 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
L429135 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
L429134 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
L429133 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Yes, Mister Harding?
L428460 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
L428459 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Yes, Mister Harding?
L428275 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
L428274 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
L428255 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
L428254 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
L428253 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Why?
L428252 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Yes, that is correct.
L428251 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ And yet you suspect her.
L428250 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ No, Miss Ratched...
L428249 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ But you have no proof.
L428248 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
L428247 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
L428233 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.'  So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
L428232 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Yes, that's perfectly correct.
L428231 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
L429100 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Mister Washington.
L429099 +++$+++ u6914 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
L429098 +++$+++ u6914 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ No! No! No!
L429097 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Get up, Billy.
L429094 +++$+++ u6914 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ M-M-Muh-Muh-McMurphy!
L429093 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Who? Tell me!
L429092 +++$+++ u6914 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
L429091 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
L429090 +++$+++ u6914 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
L429089 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
L429088 +++$+++ u6914 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
L429087 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
L429086 +++$+++ u6914 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
L428561 +++$+++ u6914 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I-I-I...
L428560 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
L428537 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
L428536 +++$+++ u6914 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I was in luh-love with her.
L428535 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
L428534 +++$+++ u6914 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
L428533 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Tell us about it...
L428532 +++$+++ u6914 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Y-y-y-yes...
L428531 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
L428261 +++$+++ u6914 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
L428260 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Yes, Billy?
L428240 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Mister Sefelt?
L428239 +++$+++ u6914 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
L428238 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Would you like to start?
L428237 +++$+++ u6914 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ M-m-m-ma'am?
L428856 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Thank you, ma'am.
L428855 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.

L428851 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
L428844 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...
L428843 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Good. Why don't you join us?
L428842 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
L428841 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ I hope everything is settled.
L428840 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Thank you, ma'am.
L428839 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Welcome back.

L428837 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Mister McMurphy.
L428766 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ No, it was irresponsible!
L428765 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
L428764 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
L428763 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
L428573 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
L428572 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ You men remain seated!
L428571 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
L428570 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
L428558 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch...
L428557 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
L428556 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
L428555 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
L428554 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ So do I!
L428553 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
L428552 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ That's it! We made it!
L428551 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
L428550 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
L428549 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ A vote is before the group.
L428548 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
L428547 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
L428546 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
L428543 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
L428542 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
L428541 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
L428540 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
L428539 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
L428538 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
L428456 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ No way.
L428455 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
L428448 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!
L428447 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
L428446 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Yeah?
L428445 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
L428444 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ 'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
L428443 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Go on...
L428442 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ I'm not finished yet.
L428432 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Right!
L428431 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
L428430 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
L428429 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Yes, Mister McMurphy.
L428409 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
L428408 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
L428407 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
L428406 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
L428405 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
L428400 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.
L428399 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ What for?
L428398 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Oh, I had them removed.
L428397 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
L428396 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ On this ward?
L428395 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ I wanna report a robbery!
L428394 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
L428377 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
L428376 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
L428369 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
L428368 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Sorry to have bothered you.
L428366 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
L428365 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
L428364 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
L428363 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
L428362 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Yes, Mister McMurphy?
L428361 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?
L428360 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Sorry, ma'am.
L428359 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
L428236 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start?  Billy.
L428235 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
L428234 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
L428203 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam.
L428202 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
L428201 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
L428200 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.
L428199 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
L428198 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Is there anything else?
L428197 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
L428196 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L428195 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
L428194 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
L428193 +++$+++ u6913 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ BIG NURSE +++$+++ Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
L428192 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Yes, ma'am...

L428164 +++$+++ u6917 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ CHESWICK +++$+++ What for?
L428163 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ What for?
L428753 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope.
L428752 +++$+++ u6918 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ FREDRICKSON +++$+++ Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
L428751 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
L428687 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
L428686 +++$+++ u6918 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ FREDRICKSON +++$+++ Mine, too!

L428634 +++$+++ u6918 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ FREDRICKSON +++$+++ What?
L428633 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
L428632 +++$+++ u6918 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ FREDRICKSON +++$+++ What? What?
L428317 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Huh?
L428316 +++$+++ u6918 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ FREDRICKSON +++$+++ Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
L428309 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
L428308 +++$+++ u6918 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ FREDRICKSON +++$+++ It's the questions she asks.
L429121 +++$+++ u6918 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ FREDRICKSON +++$+++ What?
L429120 +++$+++ u6929 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SEFELT +++$+++ Ya know what, Fred?
L429051 +++$+++ u6929 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SEFELT +++$+++ Lemme see...
L429050 +++$+++ u6918 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ FREDRICKSON +++$+++ Christ, they even got my first grade report card here...
L428709 +++$+++ u6929 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SEFELT +++$+++ My feet hurt...
L428708 +++$+++ u6918 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ FREDRICKSON +++$+++ Yeah, my feet are cold...
L428660 +++$+++ u6929 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SEFELT +++$+++ Me too...
L428659 +++$+++ u6918 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ FREDRICKSON +++$+++ Neither do I...
L428507 +++$+++ u6918 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ FREDRICKSON +++$+++ Me, too...
L428506 +++$+++ u6929 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SEFELT +++$+++ I'll bet a dollar.
L428265 +++$+++ u6918 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ FREDRICKSON +++$+++ Through the ass.
L428264 +++$+++ u6929 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SEFELT +++$+++ Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
L429076 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Sure, Mack...
L429075 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
L428909 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Scanlon out!
L428908 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ I don't trust you!
L428907 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ You can come back later!
L428906 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ I just started!
L428905 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ I'm the coach!
L428904 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ No!
L428903 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ I said out!
L428902 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ I refuse!
L428901 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
L428870 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ I was open! Come on, let's play ball!
L428869 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
L428868 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
L428849 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
L428848 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ What's your plan, Mack?
L428644 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ That's nice. Send me a post card.
L428643 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ I'm busting outta this place.
L428642 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ What for?
L428641 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
L428604 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
L428603 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ It doesn't help him.
L428602 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
L428601 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ So why are you talking to him?
L428600 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
L428599 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ He can't hear you!
L428517 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Just warmin' up.
L428516 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Giving up?
L428515 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
L428514 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Okay, sucker.
L428513 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Okay, Harding, you're on.
L428512 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Twenty-five dollars.
L428501 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ You heard me the first time!
L428500 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ With your own two hands?
L428499 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
L428498 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
L428497 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
L428486 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
L428485 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
L428477 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will!
L428476 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
L428475 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
L428383 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
L428382 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
L428381 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
L428380 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
L428326 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Now, what would I be trying to say?
L428325 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
L428324 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ That!
L428323 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Lobotomy?
L428322 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Lobotomy!
L428321 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ What for?
L428320 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
L428319 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
L428318 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
L428311 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
L428310 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
L428305 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
L428304 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Did to me?
L428303 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
L428302 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
L428299 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?
L428298 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ A pecking party?
L428297 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
L428169 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ I'm seeing what a busy man does.
L428168 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ What are you doing?
L428139 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Your buddy is callin' ya.
L428138 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Martini!
L428776 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ I'm not running a charity ward...
L428775 +++$+++ u6920 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MARTINI +++$+++ Why not?
L428774 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ No!
L428773 +++$+++ u6920 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MARTINI +++$+++ Gimme a cigarette!
L428178 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to.
L428177 +++$+++ u6920 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MARTINI +++$+++ No!
L428176 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Let me see your hand!
L428175 +++$+++ u6920 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MARTINI +++$+++ No!
L428174 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Don't you have any clubs?
L429129 +++$+++ u6929 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SEFELT +++$+++ Gary Blinker...
L429128 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Who told you that?
L429127 +++$+++ u6929 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SEFELT +++$+++ Yesterday...
L429126 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ When?
L429125 +++$+++ u6929 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SEFELT +++$+++ McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
L429124 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Hear what?
L429123 +++$+++ u6929 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SEFELT +++$+++ Just wait till you hear...
L429122 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Big king, too bad...
L428257 +++$+++ u6929 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SEFELT +++$+++ What's he talkin' about?
L428256 +++$+++ u6919 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ HARDING +++$+++ Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
L428897 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.
L428896 +++$+++ u6920 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MARTINI +++$+++ Gimme the ball!
L428894 +++$+++ u6920 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MARTINI +++$+++ I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
L428893 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
L428666 +++$+++ u6920 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MARTINI +++$+++ No! I wanna go!
L428665 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.
L428628 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Bye-bye.
L428627 +++$+++ u6920 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MARTINI +++$+++ Yeah, Mac?
L428626 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!

L428464 +++$+++ u6920 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MARTINI +++$+++ Hold it a minute.
L428463 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
L428385 +++$+++ u6920 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MARTINI +++$+++ Me. Hit me!
L428384 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
L428351 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
L428350 +++$+++ u6920 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MARTINI +++$+++ Hit me!
L428349 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ That's twenty up, Martini.  Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game?
L428348 +++$+++ u6920 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MARTINI +++$+++ Hit me.
L428347 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
L428342 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Whadaya bet, Cheswick?

L428899 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ Time out!
L428898 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Time out!
L428878 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ Time out!
L428877 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Candy. Candy, over here.  Hey, Doc, time out.
L428596 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ We'll let you know.
L428595 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ When?
L428594 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
L428593 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
L428592 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
L428591 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
L428590 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ I'm afraid not.
L428589 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
L428588 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ Yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case.
L428587 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
L428586 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
L428585 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
L428584 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
L428583 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
L428582 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ How are you feeling?
L428436 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
L428435 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?
L428226 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ Good. Good.
L428225 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ You bet, Doc!
L428224 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
L428223 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ No, this is my first trip, Doc.
L428222 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
L428221 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Doc, what can I tell ya?
L428220 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
L428219 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ That's correct, Doc ...
L428218 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ Arrested on an assault charge five times...
L428217 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ I don't, Doc...
L428216 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
L428215 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
L428214 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
L428213 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...
L428212 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ I see...
L428211 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
L428210 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ In what way?
L428209 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
L428208 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ I see.
L428207 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Poker!
L428206 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ Oh, what was that?
L428205 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
L428103 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
L428102 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ My, my... Ah, who are you?
L428101 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
L428100 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ Is that so?
L428098 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ Oh, do you do much fishing?
L428097 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
L428096 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ Oh, what's that?
L428090 +++$+++ u6930 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ SPIVEY +++$+++ Hold it!
L428089 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
L428375 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus...
L428374 +++$+++ u6925 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ NURSE PILBOW +++$+++ Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
L428373 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
L428372 +++$+++ u6925 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ NURSE PILBOW +++$+++ It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
L428371 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ What's the horse pill for, honey?
L428370 +++$+++ u6925 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ NURSE PILBOW +++$+++ Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
L428357 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ All I'm askin' is...
L428356 +++$+++ u6925 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ NURSE PILBOW +++$+++ Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
L428355 +++$+++ u6921 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ MCMURPHY +++$+++ Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...

L429041 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
L429040 +++$+++ u6923 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ NIGHT SUPERVISOR +++$+++ What are these men doing up wandering around?
L429039 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...

L429016 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ Oh, I'm all through talkin'. Now, let's just you an' me trip on down that hall.
L429015 +++$+++ u6927 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
L429014 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
L429013 +++$+++ u6927 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, yeah...
L429012 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
L429002 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin' a risk of gettin' my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean...
L429001 +++$+++ u6927 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You ol' fucker!
L429000 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
L428999 +++$+++ u6927 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
L428998 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
L428997 +++$+++ u6927 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ He's dead.
L428996 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ Is he in an asylum?
L428995 +++$+++ u6927 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I thought so.
L428994 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
L428991 +++$+++ u6927 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
L428990 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
L428986 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
L428985 +++$+++ u6927 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
L428980 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies. These are nice guys. Nice guys.
L428979 +++$+++ u6927 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Are they dangerous when they're awake?
L428978 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
L428968 +++$+++ u6927 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Is he one of the loonies?
L428967 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
L428966 +++$+++ u6927 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ That!
L428965 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ What?
L428964 +++$+++ u6927 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What's that?
L428963 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ What happened?
L428961 +++$+++ u6932 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ TURKLE +++$+++ Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
L428960 +++$+++ u6927 +++$+++ m463 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Whew! Hiya, boys!
L460182 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.
L460181 +++$+++ u7218 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Where is she?
L460180 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
L460179 +++$+++ u7218 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Well, I got to see her.
L460178 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
L460177 +++$+++ u7218 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Is Rose here?
L460176 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes?
L460057 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
L460056 +++$+++ u7219 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BROTHER +++$+++ Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
L460055 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
L460054 +++$+++ u7219 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BROTHER +++$+++ I am in awe of it, Mother.
L460053 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
L460052 +++$+++ u7219 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BROTHER +++$+++ I know, Mother.
L460051 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
L460050 +++$+++ u7219 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BROTHER +++$+++ They're filthy, Mother.
L460597 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
L460596 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
L460595 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ A saint just like your own mother. She's up in heaven right now, her and Lunette, there ain't no doubt about it.
L460594 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ What was your mother like?
L460593 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
L460592 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
L460591 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
L460590 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ How did the rabbits kill him?
L460589 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
L460588 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Five hundred rabbits?
L460587 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
L460586 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
L460585 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
L460584 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Take a little walk with me, huh?
L460583 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ What are you going to do, Rose?
L460582 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
L460581 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Okay.
L460580 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
L460524 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I don't want to know...
L460523 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
L460509 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
L460508 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ You won't die, Rose.
L460507 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
L460361 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.
L460360 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
L460359 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
L460358 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yeah, I'd believe it.
L460357 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
L460356 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
L460355 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
L460354 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ He did?
L460353 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
L460352 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
L460351 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
L460210 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ But I don't know who they are.
L460209 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
L460208 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I got an awful toothache.
L460172 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
L460171 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
L460116 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're my sweetheart.
L460115 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L460114 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
L460079 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
L460078 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Here comes Daddy.
L460046 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!
L460045 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ You're going to get yourself up and go out?
L460044 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life.  Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.
L460042 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
L460041 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
L460038 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as I've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what I did. I know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. But mostly it was dumb, I didn't mean you no harm, I'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. I love you. But they'd think I did, they'd think I was awful, they'd despise me and hate me...
L460037 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I said I wouldn't.
L460036 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
L460022 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Good night, Rose.
L460021 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
L460020 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
L460019 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
L460018 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
L460017 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
L460013 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You wouldn't understand.  Oh, God, I must be outta my mind. What would your Momma think?
L460012 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ But why, if I'm not hurting you?
L460011 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
L460010 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Am I hurting you?
L460009 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
L460008 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ But Rose...
L460007 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You better quit that.
L460003 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, nothin'.
L460002 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
L460001 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, you're just a child.
L460000 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
L459999 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
L459998 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
L459997 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
L459996 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
L459995 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
L459994 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
L459993 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
L459992 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
L459991 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
L459990 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
L459989 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
L459988 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
L459987 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
L459986 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
L459985 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
L459984 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, some fiend might.
L459983 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Who would want to do such a thing as that?
L459982 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
L459981 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Don't mention it.
L459980 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
L459979 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
L459978 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
L459977 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ 'Course it does.
L459976 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
L459975 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
L459974 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.
L459973 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
L459972 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
L459971 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
L459970 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
L459968 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ But I'm curious, Rose.
L459967 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
L459966 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
L459965 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
L459964 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
L459963 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
L459962 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Actually, I am, though.
L459961 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
L459960 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
L459959 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
L459958 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
L459957 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What did you expect?
L459956 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
L459954 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then.  But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me.
L459953 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
L459952 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
L459951 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
L459950 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
L459949 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ You were pretty bad, huh?
L459948 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
L459947 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ What'd you do, Rose?
L459946 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
L459945 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ What is it, Rose?
L459944 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
L459943 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, all right.
L459942 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
L459941 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
L459820 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, I don't want to talk to you. I'm going out and sweep the patio.
L459819 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
L459818 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
L459817 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
L459816 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
L459815 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ There was this old man that ate his niece.
L459814 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
L459813 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
L459812 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
L459811 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
L459809 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
L459808 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
L459807 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ In what sense were they bad?
L459806 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ They were just bad men, that's all.
L459805 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ But who were they?
L459804 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Nobody.
L459803 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
L459775 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Sure. Let me take your suitcase.
L459774 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
L459773 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.
L460321 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
L460320 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ Of course not!
L460070 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
L460069 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
L459878 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
L459877 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ All right, what do you know?
L459876 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ I do, too!
L459875 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
L459874 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
L459857 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ I do, too.
L459856 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
L459855 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ Neither do I.
L460602 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
L460601 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
L460416 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!  Rose, open this door immediately!
L460415 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Daddy, what's the matter?
L460414 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Open that door, damn you!
L460401 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all I am going to do!
L460400 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well... maybe...
L460399 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
L460398 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ True, but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder. Now let's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with.
L460397 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
L460396 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
L460395 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ But how would you find him?
L460394 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
L460393 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, it's not very plain.
L460392 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
L460381 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son.  Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
L460380 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
L460379 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ What do you think, Brother?
L460369 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ What's taking the rascal so long?
L460368 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yeah, he's still up there.
L460367 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
L460152 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ The girl strikes like a cobra.
L460151 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I don't know.
L460150 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
L460139 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ No. Why should Rose be in my room?
L460138 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Son, was Rose in your room last night?
L460134 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, yeah.
L460133 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
L460132 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, a little.
L460131 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ You were up late last night, Brother.
L460375 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I'll be right back.
L460374 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
L460373 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
L460096 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
L460095 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Heh, what a hypocrite.
L460075 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
L460074 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
L460073 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What'd you say, Brother?
L460072 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ She's getting herself up to go out.
L460071 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
L460066 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff.
L460065 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ No, you didn't say that, Brother.
L460064 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I said ahhh-dam stuff.
L460063 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What did you say, Brother?
L460062 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
L460061 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
L460060 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
L460059 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
L460058 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
L460049 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed in you. You mustn't look at those horrible things, they degrade the human image.
L460048 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
L460047 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
L459784 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski.
L459783 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
L459782 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
L459781 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
L459780 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
L459779 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ She talks a great deal and smiles a lot. She's very pretty, she has a real good figure. She's very girlish or womanish, if you know what I mean. She wouldn't hurt anybody, this girl. She couldn't.
L459778 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
L459777 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ The new girl is here.
L460564 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Here comes Daddy.
L460563 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Why is it taking so long?
L460506 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ If it isn't a baby... what is it?
L460505 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
L460504 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ A baby... and she isn't even married.
L460503 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
L460502 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ What's goin' on?
L460411 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
L460410 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
L460319 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Doll, don't ask childish questions.
L460318 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
L460317 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
L460316 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ What's happening?
L460298 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you!
L460297 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
L460296 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
L460194 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll. And neither does smartness. You see --
L460193 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Then why does she act so dumb?
L460192 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
L460191 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
L460190 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ So am I.
L460189 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
L460188 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
L460068 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
L460067 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ No, Mother, he's lying...
L459938 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
L459937 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
L459936 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
L459932 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.
L459931 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
L459928 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Buddy, that was my place.
L459927 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ She's putting the titty back.
L459924 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Let me look.  Aww-rr...
L459923 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ He had his hand on her titty.
L459922 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Is that all?
L459921 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ He kissed her.
L459920 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ What are they doing, Doll?
L459919 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
L459918 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ What are they doing?
L459917 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Wow! Brrrother!
L459916 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Boy! Wow!
L459915 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Now I can't see. What are they doing?
L459914 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Let me see!
L459913 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
L459912 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
L459911 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ This is my place and you can't have it.
L459910 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ I can't see, let me see...
L459909 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ They're discussing it.
L459908 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
L459898 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ At least.
L459897 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ I think she's gonna kiss him.
L459896 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Okay.
L459895 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Let's go peep from the living room.
L459894 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Yeah.
L459893 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ There goes Mother.
L459873 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
L459872 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L459871 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ She's watching the car again?
L459870 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
L459869 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ No, he doesn't. Not really.
L459868 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ I think Daddy suspects.
L459867 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
L459854 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ No.
L459853 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
L459822 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Oh, shut up, Buddy.
L459821 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
L460685 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ I'm not blubbering.
L460684 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
L460683 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
L460682 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
L460681 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
L460678 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
L460677 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
L460676 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
L460675 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
L460674 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Excuse me, I'll be right back.
L460673 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
L460672 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
L460671 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
L460670 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
L460669 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ No, son, she is dead.
L460668 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
L460667 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
L460666 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
L460665 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
L460664 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
L460663 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ A wonderful woman, boy.
L460662 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ That's what she would say herself.
L460661 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
L460660 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
L460659 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
L460658 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
L460657 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
L460656 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
L460655 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
L460654 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
L460653 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
L460652 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Is her husband sick or something?
L460651 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
L460650 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
L460649 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
L460648 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
L460646 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
L460645 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ How could that be, son?
L460644 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
L460643 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
L460642 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
L460641 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Are they polar bears, too?
L460640 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Yeah, they're in the snow.
L460639 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
L460638 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
L460636 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ It's Yankee whisky to me.
L460635 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
L460634 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
L460633 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Hello, Daddy. How are you?
L460632 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
L460538 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Yes, we know her.
L460537 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ I think we both know her.
L460536 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Of course.
L460535 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
L460534 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Please do.
L460533 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
L460532 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I am ahead of you.
L460529 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Go on, Doctor.
L460528 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
L460527 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
L460520 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
L460519 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
L460518 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
L460517 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
L460342 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
L460341 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
L460626 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
L460625 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Honey, he is Mr. Right.
L460624 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
L460623 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
L460607 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died.
L460606 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Who?
L460605 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
L460600 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
L460599 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
L460598 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ It's twenty after one.
L460567 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Fine.
L460566 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ How is she?
L460552 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Better off? How could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? Are you insane?
L460551 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
L460550 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
L460549 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
L460548 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
L460547 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
L460546 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
L460542 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Over... my... dead... body!
L460541 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
L460522 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
L460521 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ This conversation is making me a little sick.
L460501 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
L460500 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
L460495 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.
L460494 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Honey!
L460485 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!
L460484 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What did you forget?
L460483 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
L460479 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
L460478 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ She already told you, she doesn't know.
L460477 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
L460476 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
L460473 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
L460472 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
L460461 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
L460460 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
L460459 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
L460458 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
L460457 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
L460456 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
L460448 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.
L460447 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
L460446 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
L460444 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
L460443 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She does look a little peaky.
L460438 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ The hell we can't.
L460437 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
L460436 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
L460408 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
L460407 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She hasn't actually done anything...
L460391 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
L460390 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
L460372 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit.  Your real trouble is that you're anti-intellectual. The irony is women are supposed to be emotional, but I never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do.
L460371 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I don't care where the polecat studied.
L460370 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
L460350 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I don't see how you can even think of it now.
L460349 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
L460348 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ He's a polecat, dear.
L460347 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
L460346 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
L460336 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Honey, please...
L460335 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
L460315 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
L460314 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Darlin', Rose has got to go!
L460313 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
L460312 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
L460311 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
L460310 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, I have a pretty good idea.
L460309 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
L460306 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
L460305 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
L460304 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
L460303 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
L460302 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
L460301 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
L460300 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
L460299 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
L460238 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
L460237 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
L460236 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
L460235 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
L460234 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
L460233 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Now you listen to me, Rose --
L460229 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I don't intend to mock you, dear. I respect your philosophy. It's beyond my comprehension, but I respect it.
L460228 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
L460227 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
L460226 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
L460225 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Boys? You say to me boys?
L460224 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
L460223 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ -- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
L460222 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --
L460221 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
L460220 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I am not being brutal to her!
L460219 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
L460218 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
L460187 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
L460186 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
L460184 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
L460183 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
L460164 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Yes, darlin', time will tell.
L460163 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, time will tell, won't it?
L460162 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
L460161 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
L460160 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ No reason at all, darlin'.
L460159 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
L460157 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
L460156 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Is she all right?
L460155 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Quarter of twelve.
L460154 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What time is it?
L460153 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, she's back.
L460128 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Yes, of course.
L460127 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
L460126 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
L460125 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
L460124 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
L460123 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
L460122 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
L460121 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
L460120 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ She will succeed.
L460119 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
L460118 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
L460117 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
L460111 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
L460110 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
L460109 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You're not having lunch?
L460108 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
L460107 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
L460106 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
L460099 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
L460098 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
L460097 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
L460087 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
L460086 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
L460005 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
L460004 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
L459891 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ All right, darlin'.
L459890 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
L459889 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
L459866 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
L459865 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
L459864 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
L459863 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
L459862 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
L459861 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
L459860 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
L459859 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
L459858 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
L459850 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.
L459849 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
L459848 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
L459847 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
L459846 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
L459845 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
L459844 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
L459843 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Oh. Did you say something?
L459842 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
L459841 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What?
L459840 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Turn up your hearing aid.
L459839 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ What do you think of her, honey?
L459838 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
L459837 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ How goes it, darlin'?
L459836 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
L459835 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
L459796 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
L459795 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
L460575 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Nothing, Rose.
L460574 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
L460573 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.
L460571 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
L460570 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
L460569 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
L460568 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
L460493 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
L460492 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
L460491 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L460490 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
L460489 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
L460488 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
L460487 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ No, you're not.
L460486 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, I am.
L460470 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her.
L460469 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
L460468 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Your baby?
L460467 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Mine.
L460466 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
L460463 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ What?
L460462 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
L460455 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!
L460454 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You mean a farm?
L460453 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
L460452 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well. What kinda job is it?
L460451 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
L460450 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Tennessee?
L460449 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!
L460442 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L460441 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
L460435 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Mmm. Would you get me another half a-cup of coffee, dear?
L460434 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What's the use, there ain't none.
L460433 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
L460432 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
L460431 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
L460429 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
L460428 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
L460427 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
L460426 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, it was a silly question.
L460425 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
L460424 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
L460423 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, it's Billy.
L460422 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
L460421 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
L460420 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
L460406 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L460405 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
L460295 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, air.
L460294 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
L460293 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
L460292 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
L460291 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
L460287 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, I don't know what happened. They were arguin' about baseball, then all of 'em started fightin'. As for that policeman, I didn't bite him, I don't think I bit him.
L460286 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
L460285 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I got an awful bad cold.
L460273 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, no, sir.
L460272 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
L460271 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
L460270 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
L460269 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
L460268 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
L460244 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L460243 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
L460242 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L460241 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
L460232 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm not hungry.
L460231 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
L460230 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
L460215 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.
L460214 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L460213 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Strange voices, Rose?
L460212 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
L460211 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
L460146 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
L460145 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Is this ill right?
L460144 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
L460143 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ You don't know where you're going?
L460142 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, anywhere downtown.
L460141 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
L460136 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
L460135 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ You were up late last night, too, Rose.
L460130 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
L460129 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ What have you got in your hair, girl?
L460104 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ There are more on the other side.
L460103 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ How can the buttons stand the pressure?
L460102 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, it has buttons.
L460101 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
L460091 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
L460090 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
L460089 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
L460088 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're so sweet.
L460085 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yeah. I'm goin' out.
L460084 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Got yourself up?
L460083 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
L460027 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, good night.
L460026 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No, sir.
L460025 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Is anything wrong?
L460024 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
L460023 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rose, what are you doing up?
L459935 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Do you know what a friend you have got there? Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you? Is this any way to repay her trust and love? Are you ashamed as I am ashamed?  Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But let me warn you, damn your hide, this is Thermopylae and I am standing here. Do you hear me, damn you. I am standing at Thermopylae and the Persians shall not pass! Now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes, and stop crying!
L459934 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
L459933 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
L459930 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...
L459929 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you had better believe it! What are you, crazy? A man is supposed to be a fool like this, but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense! Are you a nitwit? What's the matter with you?
L459907 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Calm down, Rose, let's calm down and discuss it ...
L459906 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Don't make me... me... me... get up!
L459905 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
L459904 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
L459903 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
L459902 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
L459901 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
L459884 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I... I'll get the grits.
L459883 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
L459882 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, I don't know, I... I...
L459881 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
L459800 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L459799 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
L459798 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L459766 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me.  Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane.
L459765 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
L459764 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.
L459762 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
L459761 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
L459760 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
L459759 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
L459757 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Yeah, I remember it.
L459756 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
L459755 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
L459754 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
L459753 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
L459752 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
L459751 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
L459750 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.
L459749 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
L459748 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Well, no, I didn't actually.
L459747 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
L459746 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Um-m, well...
L459745 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.
L459744 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ I see. Outside it.
L459743 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
L459742 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
L459740 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ She has other things to do, Dave.
L459739 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Took your time gettin' here.
L459737 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us another drink!  Dumb little bitch, supposed to give us two in the first place.
L459736 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
L459735 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
L459734 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
L459733 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
L459732 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
L459731 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
L459730 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Page proof of a book I'm working on.
L459729 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Galley what?
L459728 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Galley proof.
L459727 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?
L459725 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York. But the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse.
L459724 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
L459723 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
L459722 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
L459721 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
L459720 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
L459719 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
L459718 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
L460629 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
L460628 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What's the matter with him?
L460094 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
L460093 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
L460092 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
L460032 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
L460031 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes, dear, what is it?
L459791 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
L459790 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
L460560 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.
L460559 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
L460558 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
L460557 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
L460556 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
L460545 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself, you'd go that far? Don't you think I know what you've just said and don't you think I understand the dreadful and revolting crime you've just conspired to commit?
L460544 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Illusions, Madam?
L460543 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
L460540 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
L460539 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
L460531 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?
L460530 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes, go on.
L460526 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
L460525 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
L460516 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was merely giving her the facts.
L460515 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
L460514 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
L460513 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
L460512 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
L460511 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Gonorrhea?
L460510 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
L460364 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
L460363 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
L460362 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
L460344 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
L460343 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes, thank you, Doctor.
L460338 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
L460337 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
L460334 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.
L460333 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
L460332 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
L460331 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
L460330 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Afraid of the hospital?
L460329 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
L460328 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
L460327 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She looks terrible, just awful.
L460326 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
L460263 +++$+++ u7225 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. WINTON +++$+++ I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
L460262 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
L460261 +++$+++ u7225 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. WINTON +++$+++ Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
L460260 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
L460259 +++$+++ u7225 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. WINTON +++$+++ Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
L460258 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
L460257 +++$+++ u7225 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. WINTON +++$+++ Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
L460562 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
L460561 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ Mother... is Rose going to die?
L459789 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ There are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty and that's all there is to it. Beauty is there and we have to recognize it. Now Rose, the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She looks like an angel and she is an angel, but she can be a naughty angel sometimes, although her father won't believe it. Her real name is Frances, but we call her Dolly or Doll.
L459788 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ Oh, Mother, cut it out.
L459787 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
L459786 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ You can stop it right now.
L459785 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
L460610 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right!
L460609 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
L460608 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
L460579 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
L460578 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I was offered that job as a waitress.
L460577 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
L460498 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I don't mind.
L460497 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, you don't have to.
L460482 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address.
L460481 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
L460480 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
L460475 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
L460474 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
L460440 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
L460439 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
L460387 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
L460386 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
L460385 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
L460384 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
L460383 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yeah, it's kinda nice.
L460382 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
L460323 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
L460322 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
L460275 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L460274 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
L460267 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ It'll get better now.
L460266 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No more dentists, no more dentists...
L460265 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
L460264 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Never again, never again...
L460255 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me.
L460254 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
L460253 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
L460247 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ No, Rose, he'll help you.
L460246 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
L460245 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
L460240 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Be quiet, Rose.
L460239 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I don't want to go to the dentist.
L460217 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
L460216 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
L460167 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I had better call Daddy.
L460166 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
L460165 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
L460113 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
L460112 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, Ma'am.
L460081 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
L460080 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
L459888 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You look sick if you ask me. I hate to leave you with the dishes and all, but I'm supposed to go to a meeting of the Garden Club this evening.  I'll need the car keys.
L459887 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
L459886 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
L459834 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, Ma'am.
L459833 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, you run on now.
L459832 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
L459831 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
L459830 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're so sweet.
L459829 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
L459828 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
L459827 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, I am working on my thesis.
L459826 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Are you going to get your degree soon?
L459825 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ More history, Rose.
L459824 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
L459793 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
L459792 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, no, ma'am.
L637820 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Ah.  How did they treat you?
L637819 +++$+++ u8736 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ABRAMS +++$+++ Yes.
L637818 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
L637817 +++$+++ u8736 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ABRAMS +++$+++ I'm fine.
L637816 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
L637815 +++$+++ u8736 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ABRAMS +++$+++ Abrams...
L637814 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Mr. Abraham...
L638093 +++$+++ u8757 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ YOUNG LAWYER +++$+++ As far as we know, nothing.
L638092 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
L638091 +++$+++ u8757 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ YOUNG LAWYER +++$+++ Very good.
L638090 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ How good's your intelligence?
L638089 +++$+++ u8757 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ YOUNG LAWYER +++$+++ Nothing.
L638088 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ What did he find?
L638087 +++$+++ u8757 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ YOUNG LAWYER +++$+++ She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
L638086 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
L637615 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Yes.
L637614 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
L637613 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
L637612 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
L637611 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
L637610 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
L637609 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
L637608 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
L637607 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
L637606 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ No -- we don't want this case in court.
L637605 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
L637604 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ ... tell me about this case.
L637603 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ The man's an ambulance chaser ...
L637602 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Four cases in three years ...
L637601 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
L637600 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ He was accused of jury tampering.
L637709 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it.
L637708 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ What is the truth?
L637707 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ And no one will know the truth.
L637706 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
L637705 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes.  It would be.
L637704 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ That was our insurance company's recommendation.
L637703 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
L637702 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Yes.
L637701 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You thought it was just.
L637700 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ We thought it was just.
L637699 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ How did you settle on the amount?
L637698 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
L637635 +++$+++ u8739 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
L637634 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
L637633 +++$+++ u8739 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What does it mean?
L637632 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That's the call that I'm waiting for.
L637629 +++$+++ u8739 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
L637628 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ This is going to drive the ante up.
L637627 +++$+++ u8739 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
L637626 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
L637625 +++$+++ u8739 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It looks that way.
L637624 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ... he wants to testify ...?
L637623 +++$+++ u8739 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth.  He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye.  You meet him at the hospital.'
L637622 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Gruber...
L637621 +++$+++ u8739 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
L637620 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
L637619 +++$+++ u8739 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
L637618 +++$+++ u8739 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mickey told me to come back to work.
L637617 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L637971 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Tell us.
L637970 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
L637969 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
L637968 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes!
L637967 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
L637966 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ ...We did everything we could...
L637965 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
L637964 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637963 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
L637962 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Well, we...
L637961 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ And what did your team do...
L637960 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ That's right.
L637959 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
L637957 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
L637956 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
L637955 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Tell me one?
L637954 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Well, many reasons, actually...
L637953 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
L637952 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
L637951 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ `Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
L637950 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ We went to Code Blue...
L637949 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ What did these people do when her heart stopped?
L637948 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
L637947 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...
L637946 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
L637945 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Thank you.  When Debby...
L637943 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ When she...
L637942 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Anything special about the case?
L637941 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637940 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
L637939 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637938 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
L637937 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ ...I was one of a group of...
L637936 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
L637935 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ I was her doctor.
L637934 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Say it.
L637933 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637932 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
L637931 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
L637930 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
L638377 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
L638376 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Objection!
L638184 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Your Honor...!  Your Honor...
L638183 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
L638182 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
L638181 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...to get her heartbeat back...?
L638180 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Objection, we've...
L637795 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Frank Galvin.  We've met before.
L637794 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Ed Concannon.
L638125 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Objection.
L638124 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I did.
L638121 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Do you, indeed.  I'll bet you do. Fine.  Fine.  We'll save the court the time.  We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine.
L638120 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
L638119 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
L638118 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I'm on the staff of...
L638117 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
L638116 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I am seventy-four years old.
L638115 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ How old are you?
L638114 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ `Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
L638113 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...of Anesthesiology?
L638112 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Meth...Methodology and Technique...
L638111 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ What book is that?
L638110 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Through, through his book.
L638109 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ How is that?
L638108 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I know of him.
L638107 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
L638106 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I'm just an M.D.
L638105 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Orthopedics?
L638104 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ No.
L638103 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Neurology?
L638102 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ No.
L638101 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
L638100 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
L638099 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
L638098 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Just as you are, Sir...
L638097 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
L638096 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
L638095 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
L638404 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I'm going to uphold that.
L638403 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
L638402 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
L638401 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ ...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
L638400 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
L638395 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ You may step down.
L638394 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ No further questions.
L638388 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
L638387 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
L638329 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
L638328 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Nothing further, your Honor.
L638327 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Mr. Concannon...?
L637805 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
L637804 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Huh!
L637803 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
L638393 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
L638392 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ And why, please tell us, would you think that?
L638391 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I thought I would need it.
L638390 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
L638386 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Because I kept a copy.  I have it right here.
L638385 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
L638384 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
L638383 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You've just said you signed it.
L638382 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ That's not my handwriting.
L638381 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
L638380 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I do.  Yes.
L638379 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ `They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
L638378 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ They lied.
L638375 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names.
L638374 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I...
L638373 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
L638372 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I...yes.
L638371 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
L638370 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I . . ..
L638369 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
L638368 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L638367 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
L638366 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L638365 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Just now...
L638364 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L638363 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
L638362 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ No.
L638361 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You would not...?
L638360 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I wouldn't do it.
L638359 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
L638358 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ It's a crime.
L638357 +++$+++ u8740 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
L637854 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
L637853 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
L637852 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
L637851 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
L637850 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
L637849 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
L637848 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
L637847 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ It's all right, Mickey.
L637846 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did?  Do you know what you did?
L637845 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Hold on a second.
L637844 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
L637596 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
L637595 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ What is this going to cost?
L637592 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ We just ...
L637591 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I completely understand ...
L637590 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ ... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
L637589 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
L637588 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ ...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
L637585 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
L637584 +++$+++ u8741 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DONEGHY +++$+++ ... that's all right.
L637583 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.

L638036 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?

L638031 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I am on the staff of...
L638030 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
L638029 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I am seventy-four years old.
L638028 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
L638027 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ ...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.

L638023 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
L638143 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I...um...
L638142 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ The Doctors were not negligent.
L638141 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
L638140 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
L638139 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
L638134 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Well...
L638133 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
L638197 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
L638196 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ You sure you don't want me to stay on.
L638195 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes...I...yes.
L638194 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
L638193 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
L638192 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
L638191 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ No, you did fine.
L638190 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I didn't do too well for you.
L638132 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
L638131 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
L638130 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
L638129 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
L637985 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ There's nothing they can do to me.
L637984 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...

L637980 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
L637979 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
L637978 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
L637977 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ That's what I'd planned to...
L637976 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
L637974 +++$+++ u8742 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ It was good of you to meet...
L637973 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Dr. Thompson...?
L638326 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Thank you.
L638325 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
L638324 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
L638323 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
L638322 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
L638321 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L638320 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ And you wrote that...
L638319 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ I.  Yes.  It is.
L638318 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ 'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?
L638317 +++$+++ u8743 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.  I wrote it.
L638316 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
L637672 +++$+++ u8745 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
L637671 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Uh, why, why are you doing this?
L637670 +++$+++ u8745 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ ... that's perfectly all right.

L637662 +++$+++ u8745 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
L637661 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
L637659 +++$+++ u8745 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
L637658 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ The most respected ...
L637657 +++$+++ u8745 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
L637656 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Do you know who her doctors were?
L637655 +++$+++ u8745 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
L637654 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ) I'm sorry ...?
L637653 +++$+++ u8745 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ Her doctors killed her.
L637652 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
L637651 +++$+++ u8745 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ Why?
L637650 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes.
L637649 +++$+++ u8745 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ You're going to settle out of court?
L637648 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes.
L637647 +++$+++ u8745 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ ... and you're going to do that?
L637646 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
L637645 +++$+++ u8745 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ Right.  Who called?
L637644 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
L637643 +++$+++ u8745 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ ... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
L637642 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
L637641 +++$+++ u8745 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ I read the hospital report on your client.
L637640 +++$+++ u8745 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
L637639 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I appreciate--a man as busy as--
L637638 +++$+++ u8745 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GRUBER +++$+++ Yes?  Galvin, right?

L638016 +++$+++ u8751 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
L638015 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...

L638013 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Then why don't you testify?
L638012 +++$+++ u8751 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
L638011 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
L638010 +++$+++ u8751 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
L638009 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Who are you protecting, then?
L638008 +++$+++ u8751 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ I didn't do it, Mister.
L638007 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Who put my client in the hospital for life.
L638006 +++$+++ u8751 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ And ask me what?
L638005 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand.
L638004 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
L638003 +++$+++ u8751 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ Nothing happened.
L638002 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You know what happened.
L638001 +++$+++ u8751 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ I've got nothing to say to you.
L638000 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
L637999 +++$+++ u8751 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ ...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
L637998 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
L637997 +++$+++ u8751 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ No.
L637996 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
L637995 +++$+++ u8751 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MARY ROONEY +++$+++ I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
L637994 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
L638408 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
L638407 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Exception!
L638406 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Overruled...
L638405 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I object, your Honor...
L638398 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Mr. Concannon...?
L638397 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Nothing further, your Honor...
L638155 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy.  We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end.  Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
L638154 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
L638153 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Are you done?
L638152 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
L638151 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Galvin, look, many years ago...
L638150 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
L638149 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Listen to me, fella...
L638148 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
L638147 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.
L638138 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
L638137 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
L638136 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Galvin?
L638128 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I believe that's the law...is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
L638127 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What?
L638126 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
L638123 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
L638122 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
L638082 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Defense...?
L638081 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Ready, your Honor.
L638080 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Is the Plaintiff ready?
L637893 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
L637892 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I could subpoena him if I had a week.
L637891 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ That happens.
L637890 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I had a witness disappear on me.
L637889 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
L637888 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I need an extension for my case.
L637887 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ That's perfectly all right.
L637886 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Thank you for seeing me.
L637885 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ What is it?
L637812 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm sure you would.
L637811 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
L637810 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
L637809 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ ...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
L637808 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...things change.
L637807 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
L637802 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket.  You follow me?  I'm trying to help you.
L637801 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ My client can't walk, your Honor.
L637800 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
L637799 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ This is a complicated case, your Honor...
L637798 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
L637793 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I was held up.
L637792 +++$+++ u8747 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Why is that?
L637791 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yessir.  I'm sorry.

L638053 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
L638052 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Who told you that?
L638051 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.

L638042 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
L638041 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Isn't there something you...
L638040 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Do you think it's my fault?

L637924 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You're going to stay here...?
L637923 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
L637922 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I've got to work.
L637921 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Why don't you get some rest?
L637920 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ No, no, I'm just...
L637919 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Do you want me to go...?
L637918 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I've got to work...
L637917 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ ...and is that serious?
L637916 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They, uh, they got to my witness.
L637915 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What happened...?
L637914 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
L637913 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Is this a bad time.
L637912 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What...?
L637911 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
L637788 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That's what I'm going to try to do.
L637787 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
L637786 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Maybe I can do something right.
L637785 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Maybe what?
L637784 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
L637783 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ And are they going to get it?
L637782 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
L637781 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I think I will.
L637780 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?
L637778 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
L637777 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
L637776 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
L637775 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Laura.
L637774 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
L637773 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Who says I'm the one that called it off?
L637772 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
L637771 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yes.  It was, actually.
L637770 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Really.  How wonderful for you.
L637769 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ My ex-husband was a lawyer.
L637768 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm a lawyer.
L637767 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ And what are you?  A cop?
L637766 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What Hotel are you staying at?
L637765 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ The TV didn't work.
L637764 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Why?
L637763 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I changed my room at the Hotel.
L637762 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I changed my life today.  What did you do?

L638227 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ The 'History'...?
L638226 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
L638225 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What did she do?
L638224 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Uh...the admitting nurse...

L638221 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
L638220 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...one of the other nurses?
L638219 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ `You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'

L638206 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I think we tried that.  The case is over.
L638205 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That's right.
L638204 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You use their witness.
L638203 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
L638076 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yeah.
L638075 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ And all we've got is a witch doctor!
L638074 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm swell.

L637906 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What happened, Joey...?
L637835 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
L637834 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
L637833 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
L637832 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Today is Tuesday.  What?
L637831 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Oh shit, what's today?
L637830 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
L637829 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
L637828 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
L637827 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They still have to take it to a jury.
L637826 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
L637825 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ So what?
L637824 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Mary Rooney.  She won't talk to me.  I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
L637823 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
L637822 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Been a long time, huh...?
L637758 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to get laid.
L637757 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
L637756 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
L637755 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport...
L637754 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You got a good memory, Franky.
L637753 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
L637752 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Right.
L637751 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
L637750 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Right.
L637749 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ 'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
L637748 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ No.
L637747 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
L637746 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
L637745 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
L637744 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
L637743 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Admittance form is wrong.
L637742 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
L637741 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
L637731 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I have to try this case.  I have to do it, Mick.  I've got to stand up for that girl.  I need your help.    Mick, will you help me...?    Will you help me...?
L637730 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
L637729 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...I have to stand up for her...
L637728 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
L637727 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...he's a good man...
L637726 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
L637725 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
L637724 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What?
L637723 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
L637722 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it.  We let them buy the case.  That's what I took it for.  You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
L637721 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
L637720 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
L637719 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to help her.
L637718 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
L637717 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...I'm going to need your help...
L637716 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Are you out of your mind...?
L637715 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Don't touch anything.
L637714 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Come on.  Let's get a drink.
L637713 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What do you want?

L637594 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to see you get that chance.
L637593 +++$+++ u8754 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.

L638301 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?
L638300 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I used to be a nurse.
L638299 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes.

L638292 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ How old is he?
L638291 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
L638290 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You live in the neighborhood?
L638289 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I've been meaning to come in a long time.
L638288 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Hi.  How are you doing?
L638287 +++$+++ u8748 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Hi.
L637685 +++$+++ u8746 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ That's for sure, Frank.
L637684 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ It's a long road that has no turning.
L637683 +++$+++ u8746 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yeah.
L637682 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Well, well, well.  Huh?
L637674 +++$+++ u8746 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Thanks, Franky.
L637673 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I want to buy you a drink.
L637550 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
L637549 +++$+++ u8746 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Another, Frank . . . ?
L638189 +++$+++ u8755 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
L638188 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Huh.  And why is that?
L638187 +++$+++ u8755 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L638186 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
L638185 +++$+++ u8755 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
L638179 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
L638178 +++$+++ u8755 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
L638177 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What happened in those three minutes...?
L638176 +++$+++ u8755 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ ...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
L638175 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What happened in those three...
L638174 +++$+++ u8755 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
L638173 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...they start again three minutes earlier...
L638172 +++$+++ u8755 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ As I've said we had some more...
L638171 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
L638170 +++$+++ u8755 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ We, we were rather busy...
L638169 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
L638168 +++$+++ u8755 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Yes, the roving nurse...
L638167 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...of the procedures...
L638166 +++$+++ u8755 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L638165 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...there are notations every thirty seconds...
L638164 +++$+++ u8755 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Yes, that's correct.
L638163 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
L638162 +++$+++ u8755 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L638161 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Dr. Towler...
L637883 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Okay.  Now, so he's in jail.  He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake.  As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.   P.S.  He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink  and mopes around three and a half years.   You like that story?
L637882 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Me, too.
L637881 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
L637880 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Huh.
L637879 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
L637878 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ The Big Boy did...?
L637877 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
L637876 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yes.
L637875 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
L637874 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Should I?
L637873 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
L637857 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ So far you're great.  You got a cigarette?
L637856 +++$+++ u8749 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ How'm I doing so far?
L637855 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
